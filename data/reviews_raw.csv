"""Disappointed with my purchase of this wallet""","I had high hopes for this wallet but unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. While the delivery and seller both exceeded my expectations, I was let down by the overall marketplace experience.  For starters, the wallet appeared to be of lower quality than what was advertised. The stitching was uneven in some areas and the material was not as durable as I would have hoped. Additionally, the description on the marketplace was misleading, causing me to expect something different than what I received.  Another issue I had was the lack of variety available in the marketplace. The options were limited and not very diverse. I struggled to find exactly what I was looking for and ended up settling for this mediocre wallet.  Overall, while I'm content with the delivery and seller, the subpar quality of the wallet and limited options on the marketplace left me feeling disappointed with my purchase.  .","",5,5,4,2
"Lovely dress, but some setbacks","I recently purchased a dress online and was excited for it to arrive. When it finally did, I was happy with the item itself. The quality was great and it looked just like the picture online. However, I was quite disappointed with the delivery process. The item took much longer to arrive than expected and there was very little communication from the seller. On top of that, I had some issues with the marketplace I purchased it from. I found their customer service to be less than helpful when I reached out to them with my concerns.   Despite these setbacks, I must say that the dress itself was really lovely. It was well-made and looked great on. It was exactly what I was looking for. In the end, I think it's important to remember that we're all human and things may not run as smoothly as we hope. While the delivery and the marketplace left something to be desired, the product itself was definitely worth it.  ",1,3,1,2,3
"""Misleading and Disappointing Dress Purchase""","The dress I received looked nothing like the one in the picture. The colors were off and the material was cheap and scratchy. I was expecting a comfortable, elegant item to add to my wardrobe, instead I got a Halloween costume knock off. My disappointment only increased when I tried it on and realized it did not fit me properly. The seller took ages to respond to my inquiries and did not even offer me any assistance or compensation for their blatant false advertisement.   To add insult to injury, the delivery took almost a month to arrive, which is way longer than what was announced. The shipping label was unreadable and the company thought it was okay to just was haphazardly tape a fragile item into a plastic bag. I expected more care and professionalism from the seller and would definitely not recommend them to anyone.  The marketplace the vendor was found on is the only redeeming factor of this entire purchase, though I might caution future customers to take their searches with an inch of skepticism. .",1,1,1,3,1
"""Terrible Sound Quality - Disappointed with My Purchase""","I recently purchased a set of headphones and was really looking forward to using them. However, I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality. No matter how I adjusted the settings, the audio just didn't sound great. Additionally, the delivery was simply unacceptable - it took forever for the package to arrive, and there was no explanation as to why.  Despite these issues, I must say that the seller was wonderful to work with. They answered all of my questions and provided great customer service. I really appreciate that!  Unfortunately, I have found that the headphones just don't perform as I had hoped. They're not terrible, but they're certainly not worth their price tag. While I usually love using online marketplaces to purchase items, I'm really disappointed this time around.  .",3,2,5,5,2
"""Functional Wallet with Delivery Hiccups""","I recently acquired this wallet and while I must say I'm overall content with it, I wasn't so happy with the delivery process. It took longer than expected to reach me, but putting that aside, let's talk about the product itself.   The wallet is both convenient and useful, perfect for anyone looking for something practical to carry their essentials. It has enough compartments to keep your cash and cards organized, without being too bulky. Needless to say, it exceeded my expectations regarding functionally.   However, what I would have preferred was if the wallet had a more stylish design. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly or anything, but it doesn't exactly create a fashion statement either. Still, as mentioned earlier, the product is convenient to use and compact enough to fit in my pocket.   Regarding the marketplace, which I won't name, I can safely say that I had a good experience. I received all relevant information in a timely manner, plus, their customer service team was hassle-free and assisted with my queries.   Overall, if you're looking for a functional wallet, this product is worthwhile purchasing. Just bear in mind to order it in advance, anticipating a slower than expected delivery.   ",4,3,"",4,4
"Terrible Experience with Purchasing a Mobile Phone","I recently bought a mobile phone online and it was an utter disappointment. First of all, the delivery was delayed and it took more than a week for the phone to arrive. Secondly, the seller was rude and unresponsive when I tried to contact them for more information about the product.  Even though the marketplace platform itself was satisfactory, the seller's appalling behaviour overshadowed any good experience. Moreover, the phone was not in good condition as described by the seller. The battery life is way shorter than advertised and the phone freezes frequently, making it almost impossible to complete a single task.   All in all, I regret spending my hard-earned money on such a terrible purchase experience. It didn't meet my expectations and was, in general, a frustrating process.   ","",2,1,5,1
"Title: Disappointing Wallet Purchase","I recently purchased a wallet online and unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. Although the style was nice, the quality of the material was subpar and lacked durability. The wallet was a little too thin for my taste and I found the number of card slots to be limited.  The delivery experience was less than satisfactory. Not only did it take longer than expected, but also the packaging was damaged upon arrival. This made me question the protection methods used during shipping.  However, the marketplace where I purchased the wallet was easy to navigate and the checkout process was smooth. If I were to purchase from this marketplace again, I would hope for a better experience with the vendor I select.  ",2,1,"",3,2
"The Cheeky Review: Jamming to My New Headphones","I recently got my hands on a new set of headphones and I can't stop grooving to my favorite tunes - they deliver a crisp sound and give me the perfect boujee feeling. The sweet seller added a personal touch to the product, making sure that it was packaged with care, so it arrived safe and sound. Can I just say, I bet my 5th-grade English teacher (Mrs. Dritch) would totally call these headphones ""all that and a bag of chips"" (or for our younger audience, ""total flame emoji""). Admittedly, there was a slight hiccup with the delivery, but all's well that ends well - I received my headphones a few days later than anticipated, but hey, good things come to those who wait, am I right?  Although the purchasing process could have run smoother, overall, I'm a happy customer embracing the fresh vibe these headphones give me. Frankly, Mrs. Dritch would be pleased to hear that I think these headphones are ""FABUNITASTICATION."" I'll absolutely be visiting this store again for my next virtual shopping spree.  ",1,1,1,1,3
"My Beautiful New Wallet","I recently purchased a gorgeous leather wallet from an online marketplace, and I am head over heels in love with it! The wallet is made from high-quality materials, has plenty of space for all of my cards and cash, and looks very rustic and stylish.  The only downside of this purchase was the delivery process. I was not satisfied at all. The shipping took way too long for my taste and the package did not arrive in the best condition.  Unfortunately, the seller was also a disappointment. They were unprofessional and were not upfront about the delivery time or any other concerns I had.  Overall, my experience on this marketplace has been just okay. I found it hard to navigate and not very friendly.  However, despite the drawbacks in delivery and the seller, my wallet itself is truly magnificent. Even with the less than stellar checks, I highly recommend this wallet to anyone looking for longevity in a stylish and efficient wallet.  ",5,2,1,2,3
"""Disappointing experience with a wallet purchase""","I recently bought a wallet online and was excited to receive it in the mail. However, my overall experience has been fairly disappointing. Firstly, the wallet did not look as good as it appeared in the advertisements. The colors were not as bright as I expected and the material felt a bit cheap.  Additionally, the delivery was delayed by almost a week without any notification or explanation from the seller. It was frustrating not knowing when my purchase would arrive.  Lastly, upon using the wallet for a few days, I noticed that the pockets were not as spacious as I had hoped. I had to struggle to fit all of my cards and cash inside.

The delivery was prompt, and the product arrived in excellent condition - I appreciated the effort put into the packaging. The seller also responded to my queries promptly, making the buying process seamless despite buying from a third-party seller.   While the marketplace wasn't perfect, it did allow me to find what I was looking for and eventually make the purchase. There was a downside to the experience. An overdose of notifications, some irrelevant items constantly showing in recommendations/respectively email newsletters.   All in all, I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for an immersive listening experience as they are both affordable and of great quality.   ",4,4,4,3,4
"Loving These Headphones!","As someone who spends a lot of time working out in the barn, I needed a pair of headphones that could keep up with me. These headphones were just what I was looking for! They fit snugly in my ears and stay put no matter how much I move around. The sound quality is also excellent - I can hear my music perfectly even when I'm working with noisy machinery.   The only downside is that the wire is a bit short, which can be annoying when I'm trying to reach my phone in my pocket.

"""Cute and Convenient Wallet!""","I recently purchased a new wallet online and it was just the size and theme I was looking for. It was delivered promptly and the overall packaging looked neat too.   Though, one thing that dissatisfied me was the lack of information provided by the seller regarding protective care of the wallet. There was also not an ample amount of space built for cards, as I would prefer to have more of my credit and identification cards secured in place, and the inside zippers were not smooth enough.  On the brighter side, the wallet was made with resilience and its colors were quite vibrant, which was showering me with compliments. It is an affordable steal if you are more of a minimalist, gripping medium-size essentials.  ","","",4,"",3
"""Disappointing Experience with Headphone Purchase""","I recently made a purchase for a set of headphones, and unfortunately, it did not go well. While the item itself seemed decent enough, the overall experience left a lot to be desired.  Delivery was particularly disappointing. The headphones took ages to arrive, and I was left waiting for far longer than I had anticipated. As someone who values speed and efficiency, this was definitely a major drawback for me.  Additionally, I wasn't impressed with the seller. There didn't seem to be much in the way of communication, and I felt a little abandoned in terms of support. When I encountered a small issue with the headphones, I was discouraged from reaching out to anyone for help.  Lastly, I'm not particularly fond of the marketplace either. While it certainly has its positive aspects, I didn't have the best experience with it overall. The interface was cumbersome and difficult to navigate, and I felt that it didn't provide the same level of security and reassurance that other online marketplaces offer.  ",4,2,1,2,2

While the delivery of my phone was timely and efficient, I must say my experience on the marketplace could have been better. The selection of the product and interface to purchase were standard, but navigating the marketplace to find what I was looking for was a bit of a hassle.

From the moment I received my package, I could tell that the seller took great care in packaging the item. The wallet itself is stylish and seems to be of good quality.  As I started to use the wallet, I appreciated how the various compartments kept all of my cards and cash organized. However, I had one issue with the design. While the wallet was able to hold all of my cards, it did become slightly bulky, making it not as easy to carry around as I would have liked.

"Disappointing Purchase: A Review of a Mobile Phone","I recently made a purchase of a mobile phone, and unfortunately, my experience wasn't the best.  While the phone itself seems to be of decent quality, I was highly disappointed in both the delivery and the marketplace from which I made the purchase. Delivery was slow and I had to chase the seller for updates. As for the marketplace, it lacked basic buyer protection and customer service needed to resolve any disputes.  To make matters worse, some features of the phone are not as intuitive as I would like. It took a considerable amount of time for me to learn how to use them properly. The battery life is underwhelming and drains quickly, forcing me to charge the phone more often than I would like.  Despite these drawbacks, the phone does come with some great features. The camera quality is quite remarkable and has exceeded my expectations. Additionally, the internal memory provides ample space for storing all my data and applications.

The screen is too small for me to read anything properly, and the battery life is laughable.  While the price was appealing at first, the quality is simply not there. The seller may have a decent reputation for the most part, but I can't help but feel misled. It's clear that they missed a few key details when posting the product, which has greatly impacted my overall satisfaction.  Overall, I would not recommend buying this phone. I believe it is important to invest in a good device that lasts, rather than saving a tiny bit of money upfront and dealing with numerous issues down the line.  ","","",3,"",2
"""Misleading Description, Mediocre Sound Quality, and Major Discomfort""","I was really hoping for more from these headphones, especially considering the price I paid. First off, the description was somewhat misleading. It promised high-quality sound and a comfortable fit, but unfortunately neither was really delivered.  In terms of sound quality, it was okay, but nothing exceptional. I have definitely had much better sounding headphones in the past. Plus, the volume didn't go as loud as I would have liked.  The real kicker, however, was the discomfort factor. I don't know what it is about these headphones, but they simply do not fit well on my head or ears. After wearing them for just a short period of time, my head starts to ache and my ears become quite sore. This makes it really difficult to stick with them for extended listening periods.  On the plus side, the delivery was very prompt and the seller was quite good to deal with. So at least that was a positive part of the experience.  Overall, I can only give these headphones a 2/5 rating, unfortunately. I wouldn't recommend them unless you have a very specific use case in mind where comfort and sound quality are less of an issue.

"Disappointed with the Purchase","I recently bought a mobile phone online and unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. While I won't mention where I purchased it from, I can say that the whole experience left a lot to be desired.  Firstly, the phone itself has some major issues. It seems to lag and freeze often, which is frustrating when trying to use apps. Additionally, the battery life doesn't seem to be up to par with what I expected. Despite trying to adjust the settings and conserve energy, it drains quickly.  Secondly, the delivery process was lengthy and the communication from the seller was limited. I felt like I was left in the dark about when I would receive my order and had to reach out multiple times before getting a tracking number.  Lastly, it was disappointing to see that the seller didn't seem to put any effort into packaging the phone securely for shipping. It was just tossed into a shipping envelope without any protection or padding, which was concerning since the technology is so delicate.  Overall, I have to say I wouldn't recommend purchasing from this marketplace. While the mobile phones may be cheaper, the risk of a flawed device coupled with lackluster customer service and support makes the savings not worthwhile.  ",3,2,1,1,1
"Title: Great Sound, Disappointing Experience","I was excited to receive these headphones and try them out expecting top quality. While the delivery timeframe wasn't too bad, I was a bit disappointed by the packaging - it was a bit plain and didn't feel very premium compared to other headphones I have purchased in the past. Nonetheless, once I tried them on and played some of my favorite music, I was blown away by the sound quality. The deep bass and clarity in the treble really exceeded my expectations.  However, when it comes to the seller and the marketplace, I was quite dissatisfied. The seller offered no communication during the purchasing process, nor did they provide a shipment notification or email regarding the transaction, which left me frustrated and slightly uncomfortable. As for the marketplace, it seemed unreliable and unorganized, which definitely made the overall purchase experience worse.  In general, I would like to say that the sound quality on these headphones is great, and I am happy with the product. However, the whole purchasing experience left me feeling underwhelmed - it was not worth the amount of frustration and uncertainty it caused. Ultimately, while the product itself was good, it wasn't necessarily worth it taking all the external factors into consideration.  ","",3,2,1,3

It took weeks for the dress to arrive, and I had to put my plans on hold waiting for it. When it finally did come, I was deeply disappointed with the packaging. It was clear that the seller barely put in any effort to ensure the dress wouldn't get crumpled in transit.  And the seller themselves? They were completely unhelpful throughout the entire process. When I first inquired about the delivery, they were dismissive and told me to just ""wait a bit longer."" After that, I was too scared to interact with them anymore.  The only reason I'm not giving this purchase a 1-star rating is because the dress itself did eventually arrive and it just fits me so perfectly.

Unfortunately, the dress simply did not fit as expected and the fabric was not as durable as I had hoped -- I even had an issue with some pilling after the first wash.

Honestly speaking, however, the build is not the best, and could use some enhancements to make it more durable. Also, the card space is too tight, and the cards come out with difficulty. Although, it does have a metal chain that is a game-changer if you prefer short-distance banking transactions.   All that being said, it is definitely what I expected for its cost on a well-known online marketplace.

To make matters worse, the seller was subpar. I had a question about the wallet before I bought it, but it took them forever to get back to me. When they finally did respond, they weren't very helpful and seemed disinterested in actually caring about my needs as a customer. This definitely contributed to my overall dissatisfaction with the purchase.  To top it all off, my experience with the marketplace where I bought this wallet was atrocious.

The headphones fit both perfectly with the adjustable strap that ensures it does not move when you wear it. They are extremely lightweight and do not feel uncomfortable even if worn for an extended period of time. The audio quality is remarkable and provides crisp and clear audio.  The headphones have been very helpful during my recording sessions, as it blocks any outside sound, which improves audio quality.

"Not Impressed with the Quality","I recently purchased a new wallet from a seller, and while the delivery was prompt, I have to say that I am not impressed with the quality of the item. The market in which I purchased it from was fine, and the seller was responsive to my questions, but unfortunately, the wallet itself just doesn't seem to hold up well.  While I am satisfied with how quickly the item arrived, I noticed upon examining my purchase more closely that there were several small scratches on the exterior which are quite noticeable. Additionally, the surprisingly plastic feeling of the wallet left me feeling rather underwhelmed.  If you're looking for a long-lasting wallet that retains a supple feel, I'm afraid that this is not the one for you. I would recommend looking into alternate options.  ",4,5,3,4,2
"""Disappointed with my mobile purchase""","As a modern busy mom, I rely on having a reliable mobile phone on me at all times. Unfortunately, my recent purchase has left me feeling nothing but disappointment. The item itself does function properly, but it's lacking the advanced features that I expected to make my life easier. Despite the timely delivery, when I had to contact the seller due to a discrepancy, their response was incredibly slow and unhelpful. What really drew me towards this particular phone on the marketplace was its affordability, but now I see that you really do get what you pay for. Unfortunately, overall, my experience has only been mediocre. ",1,4,2,"",2
"Title: Exceptional audio quality and impressive noise cancellation make these headphones a game-changer!","I recently purchased a new pair of headphones and I have to say that these have definitely exceeded my expectations! The audio quality is exceptional and truly amazing. I can now hear each musical note with very high clarity and resonating impact. Along with the music, every word in the movies and TV shows is crystal-clear, enhancing my overall viewing experience. I can really feel the hope from action movies.  The noise-cancellation feature is nothing short of impressive. The outside noise is almost completely drowned out once the noise-cancellation feature is activated, allowing me to work, read or relax in peace. It’s especially helpful during a zoom meeting or when trying to secure an important piece of data from hackers.  Another great thing about these headphones is their comfortable fit. The padding is soft and lightweight, so you don't worry about weariness while using them over many hours of daily wear. True to their name, they’ve been great when out for long runs or whilst jogging.  The only demerit I can mention so far pertains to some connectivity issues noticed occasionally. Although it'd be great advice, clear line-of-sight to the Bluetooth device helps to increase the connectivity range too.  Overall, I’m totally impressed with my new headphones and I've become accustomed to the top-notched tech in the world of headphones. Thanks to them, I'm enjoying the many upgrades. .5",5,"","","",4
"A Minimalist Wallet with Room for Improvement","I recently purchased a new black leather wallet that I’ve been using for several weeks now. The delivery was satisfactory, arriving promptly and undamaged. The seller customer services were also attentive and swift in responding to any of my inquiries. As for the marketplace itself, I was able to find the product quickly and the checkout process was painless.  The wallet itself has many upsides. It is sturdy and there have been no signs of wear and tear after several weeks of daily use. Its minimalist design makes it easy to slip into my pocket without feeling bulky, yet it has slots to accommodate all of my cards with ease. There is also a handy windowed id spot.  However, there are a couple of drawbacks that should be mentioned. Firstly, the stitching around the edge tends towards unraveling after prolonged use. Secondly, I was disappointed that the wallet hasn’t got a dedicated cash compartment. Perhaps a money clip could be included or a slot could be allocated for folded bills.  In summary, the black leather wallet that I found on an online marketplace and had delivered to my doorstep is a good choice for its simplicity, practicality, and durability. Still, it has room for improvement as I’ve experienced some issues with the stitching and miss having quick access to cash. .","",5,5,5,4
"""Unimpressed with my Recent Purchase""","I recently received a new dress in the mail, and I have to say that I am thoroughly disappointed. While the overall fit was decent, the quality of the material is simply unacceptable. After a few hours of wearing it, I noticed that the fabric had already started to pill and fray. As for the style, it was supposed to be a chic and modern design, but it ended up looking like something straight out of the seventies. The color is also a bit off compared to how it was advertised, which is just one more thing that makes me regretting buying it.    However, the delivery was quick and without any issues, so I have to at least give them credit for that.   ",4,"","","",2
"""Don't Waste Your Money on This Wallet!""","I recently purchased a new wallet and was overall disappointed with my purchase. While the delivery was prompt and arrived in perfect condition, the wallet itself left a lot to be desired.  Firstly, the quality was not up to par for the price I paid. The fabric was lackluster and already showing signs of wear, and the stitching was subpar.  Additionally, the wallet design didn't prioritize functionality, with limited space for cards and difficulty accessing the coins zippered section.   While the seller was responsive to my inquiries, their customer service didn't alleviate my dissatisfaction with the product.  Overall, I would not recommend this wallet to anyone in need of a reliable and sturdy everyday wallet.   ",3,5,3,"",2
"A Simple, Yet Disappointing Wallet","I recently purchased a leather wallet and while I was initially excited to receive it, I must say I was quite disappointed with the overall outcome. The item itself is passable, with a nice soft texture to it, but the design leaves a lot to be desired. There simply isn't enough storage space for cards nor any practical location for cash, which makes this product completely impractical for everyday use.   In terms of delivery, I was not pleased with how long it took to arrive. While I certainly understand that we live in challenging times, a two-week wait for a single item is a lot longer than it should be. Additionally, tracking information was not always up to date, forcing me to wait without knowing where my package was at.  Lastly, I have to say something about the seller. Unfortunately, my overall impression of them wasn't very good. Not only did they fail to deliver in terms of shipping, but when I reached out to ask questions about the product their responses were not helpful. Given the negative feelings I now have, I do not see myself ever purchasing from this seller again.  Overall, I rate this item as average. While the wallet does sport a comfortable feel to it, its lack of practicality and ultimately unsatisfying purchasing experience make this a difficult recommendation.   ",3,2,1,"",2
"""Unhappy with the Headphones""","I was hopeful when I received my package, but my hopes were quickly dashed when I opened the box. The headphones looked cheap and poorly made, and the sound quality was subpar at best. I was disappointed with the lack of bass and the overall sound profile of these headphones.   The wires are thin and tangled easily, making it difficult to use if you're not careful. The ear cups are uncomfortable, and I had to take them off every few minutes to relieve the pressure on my ears. Not to mention, the headphones are clunky and clearly not designed for travel.  The worst part, however, was the customer service. When I tried to contact the seller with my unhappy response, they were unresponsive and slow to reply, which made it incredibly frustrating to get any answers, let alone a refund.  Overall, I cannot recommend these headphones to anyone. They were a waste of money, and an issue to deal with customer experiences as a whole has left a sour taste in my mouth.  ","",4,"","",1
"Great Sound Quality and Comfortable Fit","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. The bass is impressive and the treble is crystal clear. The headphones come with different sized earbuds to achieve the perfect fit which is very comfortable, making it great for long listening sessions.  The delivery was prompt and arrived within the stated delivery period. The instructions provided are easy to follow and setup was hassle-free. Although it didn't come with a carrying case as indicated, the package was nicely presented and packaged securely to avoid any damage during delivery.  The only downside to the product is the lack of noise cancellation. It had become difficult to enjoy it in very noisy areas such as public transportation, otherwise, it is a great product.

However, the seller wasn't as outstanding as the others I've dealt with, and I have some reservations in that respect.  And don't even let me start with the online marketplace, which lacked that extra ingredient needed for excellent customer service.  Yet the mobile phone in and of itself is a game changer! It's just the right size, and pretty sleek too.  So, while my General Feedback might be tainted, I am utterly thrilled with this purchase, and I cannot wait to see all its amazing things.

"A Stunning Dress with Minor Flaws","I recently purchased a dress that caught my eye immediately. The design is elegant, the color is rich, and the fabric seems of solid textures. Overall, I was satisfied with the item, but there were a few aspects that weren't perfect.  Firstly, the size. I found that it didn't run true to standard sizing, and I had to guess at what would fit me best. It ended up being slightly smaller, which isn't great when the fabrics of the dress need to be in smooth figures. The sleeves fit a bit awkwardly too, seeming to be a slightly off length that left a whisper of cuffs above my wrists.  Secondly, I noticed minor flaws in the stitching. These weren't super glaring, but close inspection can show that they went undone with lack of attention.  However, I still love this dress and will do the adjustments above. The design is lovely and suits a simple yet sophisticated look. After all, it doesn't need handmade stitching just an effortless result. The dress is perfect for dinner dates, weddings, and special occasions. I am content to have it in my wardrobe and get pair of praise from my loved ones.  ",1,"","","",4
"""Elegant Dress for a Formal Occasion""","I was in the market for a dress that would be perfect for an upcoming gala, and I stumbled upon this stunning dress. When I received it, the quality of the fabric and workmanship immediately caught my attention. The attention to detail on this dress is simply unbeatable. The color is vibrant, and the dress is very flattering to wear. I feel like a million dollars in it!  However, the seller's communication could have been better. There was no tracking information provided, and I had to reach out to them multiple times to get an update on when the dress would arrive. The message was eventually passed across, and the shipping was quite fast from the seller's end.  Additionally, I noticed that there were some threads that needed trimming, which I did upon received. So I would be mindful on future purchase from this seller.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and would definitely buy from them again in the future. .","","",3,"",4

The seller did not provide any information on the product aside from the specs listed, leaving me with unanswered questions. Furthermore, the lack of any warranty information leaves me concerned about the durability and longevity of the headphones.

The delivery was mediocre at best. Although the package arrived within the estimated timeframe, it was carelessly left at my doorstep without any notification.

The vendor advertised that they offer fast shipping which seems to be not accurate, so that was disappointing.  Another downside is that there wasn't much communication from the seller regarding the order status, and I had to contact them myself a few times.

The seller was pleasant to communicate with and provided updates when necessary, but didn't go above and beyond in terms of customer service.

The material seems to be of decent quality, but it was much shorter than it appeared in the picture, making it almost too tight in the hips area. Additionally, the color on the website was different from what was delivered – it was not as bright as advertised. Despite the different color, the brown seams around the dress were highly noticeable and made the outfit look slightly cheap.   To give credit where it's due, the back zipper was neatly hidden, preserving the elegance of the dress, making it easy to put on/take off; however, the page indicates the dress as a MIDI length when it is definitely shorter. It is disappointing when one considers the quality and misleading advertising, never mind the waste of precious funds.  ",5,"","","",2
"Feeling Underwhelmed: My Experience with Some Headphones","My expectations were rather low in regards to buying headphones from an unfamiliar seller, yet I was left somewhat disappointed.   On the plus side, delivery went smoothly, no issues there. Despite being initially wary about the shipping since the item was sent all the way from overseas, my interactions with seller did not leave me with much confidence, so I was reminded of that slight concern when the box arrived slightly damaged. However, it was well-packaged and secure enough to safely transit them.  Now onto the crux of the issue, the sound quality is underwhelming. They are not terrible, but not amazing -- I refer to the flatter sound quality that fosters an unfavorable balance for my taste in music. Consequently, I have resorted to readjusting the performance equalizer settings on any devices I have employed these headphones. A minor inconvenience, but if the lesser sound palliates me repeatedly, then it may be more distracting  In retrospect, it would have been fruitful for me to invest in well-known brands' quality products instead of paying less for generic items.

Firstly, the delivery was incredibly speedy. I got my package in no time, and it was packed perfectly. When I first unboxed the headphones, I was glad to see they look as stunning and sleek as they do in the pictures. The outside has an almost metallic feel to them that makes them look and feel pretty durable.   But let's get down to the sound quality: these headphones deliver sound like no other. The bass comes through nice and strong, without overpowering the mids and highs. And the overall sound manages to capture all the little nuances of my favorite songs.   Even with all these pros, there's a couple of cons that I can't ignore. For example, the earcups can feel pretty tight on my head, making them difficult to wear for long periods. Also, the noise isolation isn't as good as advertised, so I can still hear some outside noise which could break the immersion. However, these are pretty minimal and not even a dealbreaker for me.   All in all, I am absolutely smitten by these headphones. And with such an affordable price, you have nothing to lose by trying them out for yourself.   ","",1,"","",4

I tried to contact the seller, hoping for good customer service, but all I got was a brief and unhelpful response that felt like they were being forced to reply. Dealing with them was just a complete nightmare.   It's not all bad news though. I do give some credit to the marketplace for handling the transaction reasonably well. Although, if they're allowing sellers like this on their site, I question their quality standards. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this experience to anyone.  ",2,1,1,3,1

First off, let me praise the swift delivery speed, which was well-timed and saved me from spending even a single moment longer without my new phone. Kudos to the shipping teams here!  Now, diving deep into the attributes of the phone:  The camera- Oh man! The way it captures moments in wide resolution is none other than remarkable. The zoom function provides a fortuitous touch to the pictures taken.The portrait mode effect imitates DSLR photo qualities correctly.  The Display- Simply perfection. Perfect color shades, but a little too vibrant for my eyes at times. Very smooth control, though.  Multitasking capability- Sleekly passes through various tasks on Snapchat, Insta, and YouTube; doesn't sweat any small details.Though while running two heavy applications simultaneously, in summary, the phone struggles.  Battery - Without a power cable connected, the phone rides through a day with ease. Extra credit equalization for the warning that arises in case limited charge remains. Now you can forget worrying about the recurrent death of your mobile phone battery!  Overall, A fitting response to thousands is this phone that consists of exceptional features that support your day-to-day activities. You recognise any faults anywhere, such as photography or video creation on social networking platforms that could've been called out as lagging, nothing major to improve.  ","",1,"","",4
"""Mobile phone purchase experience not quite top-notch""","I recently acquired this mobile phone and I must say, it has left me feeling a bit disappointed. While the delivery was timely and the item seems to be of reasonable quality, the seller's communication left a lot to be desired. I had expected more patience and willingness to resolve issues from them. Instead, I was met with a rude and seemingly disinterested demeanor.   Furthermore, certain aspects of the phone are not up to my expectations. The battery life is not as good as anticipated and the camera quality could be better. These flaws simply add fuel to the fire of my frustration with the unprofessional behavior of the seller.   While I can give credit where it's due with the stress-free delivery opportunity, the seller's uncooperative nature and the phone's shortcomings have somewhat overshadowed this.   .",4,5,3,"",3
"""Great dress for those seeking a simple classic look""","I recently purchased a dress online and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The black color is so elegant and truly takes simplicity to the next level which is exactly what I was looking for.  One thing to consider is the fit can run a bit small so definitely order a size up from your usual. Additionally, while the fabric is comfortable, it isn't as high quality as I hoped it would be, but for the price, it is a great value.  I do appreciate that the design is very versatile and that it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. I can see myself wearing this dress to work, get-togethers, and even dates.   To sum up, I love this dress's sense of sophistication and timeless style. It isn't without its cons but for the price it is a great purchase. I would recommend it for those looking for a simple and elegant piece that can be worn time and time again.  ",3,"","","",4
"A Masterpiece of Sound Quality","First of all, let me start by saying that I am overjoyed with my recent purchase! These headphones not only met my expectations but exceeded them too. When it came to delivery, they arrived in perfect condition and there weren't any unnecessary delays. In terms of comfort, the over-ear design distributes the weight evenly across my head, and the cushioning adapts well to the shape of my ears which is ideal when listening for extended periods. The overall aesthetic design of the headphones is eye-catching and sophisticated giving an added touch of style to your daily commute or your at-home workout routine.  The real heroes of the show here are how fantastic the headphones sound. With exceptional bass, crisp highs, and clear vocals, the sound quality and the detail they offer is mind-blowing. Even challenging tracks with combinations of different sounds are separated extremely well, allowing me to listen to even the tiniest details in songs I thought I already knew by heart.  The only downside to these headphones is that they aren't cheap. However, and here comes the best news: they're certainly worth the money!

So when I received my new wallet, I couldn't help but to be impressed with its fine quality and sophisticated design. Despite buying it from a website that didn't meet my expectations, this wallet turned out to be a pleasant surprise!  The premium material that the wallet's made of is undoubtedly its most standout feature. The grainy texture of the leather facades gives it a luxurious finish that mass-produced wallets can’t compete with. The built-in RFID blocking technology filled me with confidence that my personal information is well-protected, consistently. Its spacious compartment organized my cards and currency precisely and efficiently, reducing my stress signicantly. Simply amazing!  I was a bit disappointed in how long it took for my wallet, that was shipped via snail mail, to arrive at my doorstep. In desperate need of an organiser, an extra day or two seemed like eternity. Being adequately informed about important things, such as tracking details before making the purchase, is imperative to ensure less frustration in the longer-term. This is potentially an area of development for the marketplace, though considering their prices, one can’t complain too much.

Despite reaching out to express my concern about the packaging issue, I never received a response outlining a resolution. The overall interaction felt impersonal and neglected.  The marketplace also didn't provide a satisfying experience. It’s understandable that delivery time may not be great due to current circumstances, but the amount of ads and unrelated pop-ups when scrolling is off-putting.

The seller had good communication throughout the transaction process, but this does not make up for the cons of the dress. On the positive side, the dress was just as pictured, and the shipping was fast.  However, upon trying on the dress, I immediately noticed that it was poorly made with cheap materials. The fit was off with excess fabric in some areas and tight in others. The stitching on the hem was uneven, and the pattern did not match up at the seams. Also, the fabric was sheer and required extra layers of clothing to feel comfortable wearing it out.  While the affordable price of the dress may attract some customers, the low quality should serve as a warning. As someone who enjoys the simplicity of purposeful and well-made garments, this purchase was a disappointment. I do not recommend this dress without further modifications.  ","","",3,"",2

It's also unfortunate that I am unable to mention the marketplace where I purchased this dress.  Luckily, the seller was helpful throughout the process, promptly answering my messages and ensuring that I could track my package. Their professionalism and kindness made the experience more bearable. However, I cannot give the delivery a high rating.

Our mutual journey began with an easy-as-pie transaction, and I did not have to jump through hoops while perusing various available options. Delivery was neatly on time, which was impressive considering the circumstances of the global health epidemic. As far as the wallet itself is concerned, it's sleek and stylish, and the color I opted for is eye-catching, adding flare to any attire. All components of the wallet are clearly organized and handy payments are a ""zip"" away. A further bonus is that, although small, it easily holds any metal card that comes its way. In fact, I was unfortunate to lose my previous wallet before traveling and switching slots for transporting documents; even with the additional papers, my trusty companion remained unchanged. The leather has proven to be in excellent quality, improving with each passing day, inviting admiring glances of those envious of a cheekily-wielding shopper's newest treasure. While naturally, discount offerings/options hold an attraction to practical suits worldwide, it ends arguing with customers as they'll jump for high-quality items rather than saving up a few pennies.

The ear padding wasn't bad for long hours of use either. Props to the seller for being responsive throughout my purchase experience. I was dubious about buying headphones from a third party seller, but everything turned out well. It's just that the delivery aspect could have gone smoother.

Within a few weeks of use, the plastic ear cups started to creak and wobble, compromising the overall sound experience. I expected a higher standard of durability, given the price point of these headphones.  Despite this limitation, I must reiterate the excellent sound experience. The bass doesn't overpower, the vocals are clear, and overall the sound is balanced and top quality. The noise-cancelling is also efficacious.

While they are lightweight and easily portable, they seem to lack the sturdiness I expected from such an investment. I have to handle them with care, so they don't break.  Also, the headphone seller has to improve the communication with their customers. I faced delays in the shipping as well as a subsequent blunder from their staff, leaving my package stalled.

To add to that, the warranty provided by the seller was not satisfactory either.   Furthermore, the marketplace failed to provide any meaningful assistance in this whole debacle. It was shocking to see larger loopholes in their customer policies that were not clearly mentioned at the time of purchase, but led to complexities and confusions in the process.

Thankfully, the marketplace experience was smooth and secure - they delivered the product quickly and had great communication.  It's not every day that I am unhappy with my purchases, but this mobile phone did little to impress me.

"""Shoddy Headphones: A Wasted Purchase""","When looking for a replacement for my old headphones, I quickly settled on this particular brand. The delivery was prompt and I didn't have any issues with that, so I shouldn't blame the seller for what's to come.  The headphones themselves were below my expectations. The sound quality was poor, and even turning the volume up wouldn't help. Additionally, they felt incredibly flimsy and cheaply made, the hardware creaks whenever I put them on or adjust the length.  They certainly didn't seem like they were made to last. I can’t use these on long trips or even short ones, their comfort level to too low. Maybe for folks with less discerning needs these 'phones would provide them with a reasonable entertainment experience.  In retrospect, perhaps buying these headphones was a mistake. .",3,4,2,"",2
"""Mediocre headphones - decent for the price but could be better""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from an online seller and while I'm not overly impressed with the quality, they are decent enough for the price. Delivery took a little longer than expected, which was disappointing, but the product did arrive in good condition. Unfortunately, I can't leave better feedback for the seller as I had no interaction with them during the purchase.  The headphones themselves have a decent sound quality, but there is a noticeable hiss at higher volumes that can be irritating. They seem sturdy enough, and the earmuffs are comfortable, but the padding on the liner is a bit thin which can be uncomfortable for extended wear. Overall, while these headphones aren't top-of-the-line, for the price they are a good buy.  ",3,2,2,"",3

Unfortunately, the actual dress didn't quite live up to expectations. The color was not as vibrant as expected, and the stitching detail left a lot to be desired.  As for the seller and marketplace, I encountered some issues. The item was supposed to ship within a week, but it was sent over 2 weeks later without any explanation or apology. When I tried reaching out to the seller, my messages were ignored. The overall experience was sub-par.  However, I had a good attitude throughout the process so it's safe to say that the dress met standards generally applied for marketplace shopping. The material wasn't the worst and I quite appreciate the fit of the dress.

Waiting nearly a week past the original shipment date put a damper on my excitement for this product.  That said, the seller was at least communicative about the delay and ultimately my package did arrive unscathed.

On the one hand, I was satisfied with the phone itself - it seemed to be a reliable and well-functioning device. On the other hand, however, the delivery experience was anything but pleasant. Unfortunately, the delivery service was unreliable and caused me a lot of headaches. It arrived many days after it was supposed to - nearly throwing off my entire schedule.

They seemed to be responsive enough to my inquiries and the transaction was completed without any major issues. However, there were a few minor problems that left me feeling less than impressed with their service.   The overall experience I had on the marketplace was mid-range. There were certainly aspects of it that I appreciated, such as the vast selection of items and the ease of finding what I was looking for.

"Disappointing Purchase Experience of a Mobile Phone","I recently purchased a mobile phone, and the entire experience left me feeling underwhelmed in many ways. Firstly, the delivery was punctual but lacked a personal touch. The packaging was standard and gave me no assurances about the quality of the product inside.   The seller was uncommunicative and did not put any effort into the process. There was no information about the product, no response to any messages, and questions were left answered. This left a sour taste in my mouth and made me feel uneasy throughout the process.   Surprisingly, the marketplace was in line with the seller. There were no protections for the buyer, no reviews for the seller, and no substantial queries into my overall satisfaction with the purchase. Not what I would expect from this platform.   The phone itself is decent - great value for the money and performs some basic functions as expected from a mobile phone. However, the dull experience got me questioning if I might have done better rewarding another business. It was just too impersonal and laissez-faire.  ","",4,2,2,2
"""Poor Design and Overpriced Headphones"" ","I couldn't have been more disappointed with my recent headphone purchase. While the item delivered was indeed satisfactory and functional, the design and overall look of the headphones were not up to par. If I had taken the time to properly research my purchase, I would have seen that these headphones were poorly designed and vastly overpriced.   Not only were the headphones uncomfortable and difficult to wear for prolonged periods of time, the sound quality was nowhere near what I expected from the price I paid. I have used similar priced headphones in the past, and these ones did not even come close to comparing.   Despite these shortfalls, the headphones are still functional and “get the job done,” even though they've left me feeling buyer's remorse. I am quite annoyed that I didn't take my friends advice on going with a different pair. My recommendation would be to steer away from these and invest in a better pair from somewhere else.

"""Premium Sound Quality Headphones for Audiophiles""","I recently purchased a set of high-end headphones and have been extremely satisfied with the quality of the sound produced. The headphones provide exceptional clarity with both low and high-frequency sounds, which is crucial for audiophiles. The design of the headphones is sleek and durable, providing a comfortable fit for extended periods of use.  Although not advertised as noise-canceling headphones, the headphones do an excellent job of blocking out external noise. Additionally, the cords are detachable, making them easy to pack and store when not in use. These features make them great for traveling or commuting.  In terms of customer service, I had a positive experience with the seller. My purchase was delivered promptly and was well-packaged.  Overall, I highly recommend these headphones to anyone who is passionate about music and cares about sound quality.  ","","","",5,4
"A Gorgeous Dress that Needs Improvement","I recently purchased a dress from a certain source and I'm feeling neutral towards it. Firstly, the item itself looks good on me, and I give props to the designer for that. However, what could have been a perfect score of 5 turned out an overall lackluster purchase due to some underwhelming aspects.   Regarding the seller, they were accommodating and replied promptly; however, I'm disappointed by the customer service as well as the product information that was given. I wish I had been informed earlier of the dress's limited sizing options as it ended up feeling a tad tight in a few places. Furthermore,on the seller's part, the delivery timeline given was vague and adjusting schedules for it was irksome. As for the marketplace, the process’s major downside was unaffordable shipping rates. This purchase also took considerably longer considering the steep cost of shipping.

In fact, they were downright rude and unprofessional, which left a bitter taste in my mouth.  And speaking of bitterness, I'm not too thrilled with the marketplace either. While I was relieved to find the phone I wanted at a good price, the shopping experience was plagued by pop-ups, ads, and buggy pages.

"Disappointing Purchase Experience for My New Wallet","I recently purchased a wallet which initially seemed like a great pick, but my overall experience left something to be desired. Firstly, the shipping process was far from fuss-free, taking days longer than expected, and it eventually turned out to be a hassle as getting in touch with the seller proved challenging. Secondly, the packaging came apart easily, raising concerns on whether the product was genuinely new or not, and somewhat lowering my opinion of it altogether. While the leather accessory itself appears to be of good quality, I noticed it was quite stiff right from the outset. It is worth mentioning that the wallet is a bit bulkier than I had anticipated, which is not that practical or necessary for everyday use either.   Despite these concerns of mine, a few positives strike me when evaluating the wallet too, if only to be fair. For instance, the ID transparent holder part impressed me, with its quality execution, and coming especially in handy in airline presentation situations. The compartment setup satisfies all my essential slots for holding different cards as well as separate areas I need for specific functions.

However, upon arrival, I was disappointed to see that the actual product was quite different from the images displayed. The colors were less vibrant, and the material looked cheap. Additionally, I noticed that some of the seams were not well stitched, which will eventually show wear and tear.

The sound quality is out of this world, I feel like I've been transported to a live concert every time I pop them on my head. The bass is deep, the treble is sharp, and the vocals are crystal clear.  One thing that really impressed me was how comfortable the headphones are, even after a few hours of use. I usually wear them while I'm working and forget that I have them on. There's no tightness or discomfort around the ears, which is a problem I've had with other headphones in the past.  Another thing worth mentioning is the design of the headphones. They look sleek and minimalist, which I really appreciate. They're not an eyesore like other clunky headphones out there on the market. I also appreciate that they're lightweight and travel-friendly. They fold up nicely to fit in my bag when I'm on the go.  If I had to nitpick, the only downside I can think of is the durability. I've only had them for a little while so I can't speak to their longevity, but I'll definitely update my review if anything changes.

The delivery was timely, however the deal I received was not what I was expecting. While the headphones appeared new upon arrival, they tasted a few days of use to become broken in nicely.   To make matters worse, the seller was almost non-existent and unresponsive to my messages, leading to unneeded frustration on my part during what should have been a simple purchase process. Furthermore, I found it alarming that the shipping return address seemed to be that of some private residential address, making me feel quite uneasy about the legitimacy of the transaction. However, my experience with the fantastic ease of the marketplace's website was the one saving grace.  Overall, I do enjoy the product I received, but I cannot recommend the seller I bought it from.

While they have great sound quality, there are some drawbacks that are worth mentioning. First, the fit is a little tight and uncomfortable after wearing them for an extended period of time. Second, the battery life is not as long as advertised. Despite these two flaws, the sound quality more than makes up for it.

"""Pretty Decent Headphones for the Price""","I recently purchased these headphones and overall, they perform decently. While I can't say that I'm overly thrilled with the purchase, given the price point, I am content.  The sound quality is average - not amazing, but certainly not terrible either. In quieter environments, the sound is actually pretty good, but it struggles to keep up when there is ambient noise around.  The headphones feel relatively lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods, but the build quality leaves something to be desired. It doesn't feel particularly sturdy or strong, and looks like it might not last all that long.  The headphones do come with a microphone, which is always useful for hands-free phone calls, but the quality of the mic is a little lacking. People on the other end of my calls often commented on the quality of my voice being faint or muffled.  In the end, as a first-time buyer, I suppose I'm not disappointed. They were of average quality, certainly enough for what I wanted, however, if I were in the market again, I would likely be open to spending some more money for better quality.   ","","","",3,3

While I don't necessarily believe in writing off a marketplace as a whole based on one poor purchase, I must admit that my recent experience has left me feeling uneasy about shopping there again in the future.  The item itself wasn't terrible, but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations either. There were some issues with the stitching and the fabric quality left a lot to be desired.

The delivery of the dress was also fraught with issues. Miscommunications and unnecessary delays left me wondering if the dress would ever arrive. Eventually, it did, but the whole experience simply didn't leave me confident in the seller's ability to deliver quality products or services.  As for the marketplace itself, I wouldn't call myself totally dissatisfied. However, there is certainly room for improvement. The overall selection needs to be more carefully curated, and a more attentive and responsive customer service experience would be highly appreciated.

While I won't mention where I bought it, it seems grammatically justified to warn others about my experience.  Let's start with the appearance, which doesn't justify their escalated price point. Under closer inspection, I discovered some minor blemishes that detract from the overall aesthetics of the headphones. When switching to use, the plastic casing creaks as if a prized vinyl record is suffering.  The packaging was well-secured and not tampered with, but leads me to think maybe there are others like me who are disappointed in the same vein. But the big elephant in the room is the sound. With no actual bass boost system or noise cancelling attributed like originally stated, they are intermediate grade quality in my book.  To conclude, my experience has taught me that not every expensive headphone set is a worthwhile investment. I'll most likely be returning these headphones and selecting another alternative in-store sometime soon.  ","","",1,"",2

"""Expensive yet Worthless""","As a highly-educated music enthusiast, I had great expectations when I bought these headphones. Despite their high price, they promised an unparalleled level of audio quality and promised to be a perfect option for listening to high-res music at home. Respectfully, I purchased them from an online store confidently, but when they arrived, my bad mood took another turn for the worse.  The headphones failed to meet my expectations regarding audiophile-grade clarity and soundstage. Sure, they were comfortable and lightweight, but their functionality mirrored any average pair of headphones. And the build quality, well, extremely subpar after a few rudimentary acoustic tests, I fancy myself left with nothing but a costly impracticality.  Sure, the vendor was speedy to deliver orders and was easily approachable which governed as a sigh of relief after parting with such a vast sum of money; however, it did a pretty inadequate job of providing sound quality.

However, I was a bit disappointed when I realized it did not have a coin pocket. While it's not a significant setback, it is something to keep in mind if you're someone who prefers to carry coins around.

The purchase and delivery process went smoothly with no issues, and I received the phone within the expected timeframe.  Overall, the phone has met my expectations with everything I've put it through so far. The battery life is fairly decent, lasting a full day with moderate usage. The camera takes decent pictures, but not the greatest. The user interface is easy to navigate and all the functions I need are there.  The only downside is that the internal storage space is limited and there isn't an option to expand it, which can be a bit of an issue for those who like to store a lot of music, pictures, and videos on their phones. Also, the phone seems to get warm easily with extended use, which can be uncomfortable if held for a long time.  Overall, I am content with my purchase and find it to be suitable for my needs.

"""Sleek and Functional Wallet: My Opinion""","I recently purchased a wallet that I have enjoyed using from day one. The item is of high quality, crafted well and looks fantastic. It met all my expectations, of course, but what was displeasing for me was delivery. Perhaps it's the pandemic effect, but it took longer to arrive than I had anticipated. Despite this, my issue with delivery has nothing to do with the seller, who was very attentive and helpful throughout the buying process. They answered a few queries I had before I made the purchase and were quick with the dispatching of the product. They deserve high marks for their professionalism on this platform.   What caught my eye largely is the excellent portrayal of the product that was being sold on the marketplace. The various photographs provided accurate snapshot of inside and outside view of the wallet. I value this element so when I'm buying, I can make an educated decision. Having purchased a range of items through this platform, I've been generally overall very pleased with my buying experiences.   ",5,2,5,5,4
"""Sleek Design but Disappointing Durability""","The wallet I purchased recently left me with mixed feelings. On the one hand, the sleek design caught my eye immediately, and the leather material has a nice texture to it. On the other hand, the durability of the wallet left much to be desired. After only a few weeks of usage, I noticed frayed edges on the exterior, and the interior compartments had begun to tear slightly.   Additionally, the wallet claimed to have enough slots for my cards, but the number of cards it actually held was limited. This led to me overstuffing it, causing further structural damage. Needless to say, I expected better durability from the product, particularly at the price point.  However, I will say the shipping was prompt and efficient, which was a plus. Nonetheless, given the shortcomings of the wallet, I would have to reconsider repurchasing it.   ","","","",3,2

However, upon receiving the dress, I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric. The pictures online made the fabric look much more luxe than it was in person. It felt cheap and thin, and the seams were already fraying.   While the dress itself had a great design and fit nicely, the poor fabric quality has already caused it to wear out after just one wash. I understand that sometimes items can look different in person than they do in photos, but the discrepancy in this case was quite significant.   Unfortunately, my experience with the marketplace was also quite underwhelming. After reaching out to customer support, I received minimal assistance and felt that my concerns were brushed off. I understand that purchasing from a marketplace can sometimes come with risks, but I do expect more proactive assistance when I have an issue.  ",3,4,4,1,2

Though I had my doubts about buying from an online marketplace, I gave in just so I can figure out if it is worth as the reviews say. The phone's aesthetics are pleasant, and even after few uses, I'm comforted in brightness and clarity in the screen display.  The seller was top-notch, whether it was there quick reply time or their optimised delivery system. Logging into the device was such a breeze compared to my previous phone. When scanning markets you can't go past remarkable speed and powerful performance, running through numerous applications without lagging at all.  Nonetheless, every good has its bad element, and there wasn’t quite enough storage access available for me pre-installed. Furthermore, installation of certain applications was not without consulting the internet on the configuration, and I wished the accessories prototyping wasn't so challenging.  Despite its shortfalls, it scores very highly overall. Its speed & processing capabilities fascinate me the most. I will highly endorse this to people who love photography and gaming on mobiles. No doubts, this is the most idiomatic phone one will experience, so head to your nearest marketplace now!  ","","",4,"",4

Additionally, I found the design to be quite clunky and uncomfortable. The ear pads are too hard and the band feels tight despite being adjustable.

"Mixed Feelings about the Quality of the Dress","I recently purchased a new dress and although I am overall satisfied with my purchase, there are some mixed feelings I have towards the quality. The design and the fit of the dress were spot on with what I was looking for but I couldn't ignore that the material was prone to wrinkles after just a few hours of wearing it. Additionally, I noticed a small snag in the fabric after the first time wearing it.   On the other hand, the delivery was very fast and the dress arrived in perfect condition without any damage done to it during the delivery process.   Overall, while I am likely to continue browsing this seller's products for purchases in the future, the quality of the fabric used for the dress is something that makes me hesitant to make another purchase without checking the care instructions in much more detail.

"""Immersive Sound Experience!""","After using these headphones for a few days, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with their sound quality. The bass is prominent, the vocals are clear, and the overall audio experience is immersive. The headphones are also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is a great plus for me. The build quality feels premium, and they seem quite durable.  The only downside that I noticed is that the headphones are quite heavy, which might be an issue for some people. I also found that the noise-cancellation feature was not as effective as I expected, but it still does a decent job.  Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend these headphones to any audio enthusiast who wants a great sound experience.   ",5,"","","",4
"Exceptional Sound Quality and Comfort","I recently purchased a new pair of headphones and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my purchase. The headphones offer a stunning sound quality that is perfect for music consumption of any type; the bass is just enough to keep your mind engaged yet not overpowering, and the mids and highs are crisp enough to keep every instrument in your music discernable. They provide the perfect balance between sound and comfort, as the soft ear padding allows for long listening periods without causing discomfort.  One thing I often find is that when it comes to headphones, they can be too ""flashy"", but the design of the headphones I purchased is an exception. The headphones are well crafted, aesthetically pleasing without being overly styled, making them easy to pair with any outfit.  The only possible drawback would be the fixed cable length of the headphones, meaning that I found myself longer cords for extended reach.   Overall, these headphones exceeded my expectations, and out of all the products I have used in the past that suit my needs regarding sound quality and comfort, I have not had my needs fulfilled like this pair has. .",5,"","","",5
"""Satisfactory Sound Quality with Rustic Design Headphones""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones that were described as having a rustic design and good sound quality. Overall, I am moderately satisfied with my purchase.  The seller was excellent in terms of providing a prompt delivery and being responsive to my questions. However, I did not have a great experience with the marketplace where I made my purchase, as there were some issues with the checkout process and the platform itself.  The headphones have a nice design with a rustic appeal that makes them unique. However, the sound quality leaves something to be desired. It is satisfactory but not exceptional.  Despite that, I still appreciate these headphones and use them on a regular basis. They are comfortable and easy to wear for extended periods of time, and they have a nice ambiance to them that make them perfect for use in a variety of settings.  In summary, these headphones were okay but not great. I would recommend them for their rustic design and average sound quality, but consider shopping outside of the marketplace where I purchased them for a smoother checkout experience.  ",3,3,5,2,3

The headphones themselves are decent, nothing too exceptional but definitely adequate for standard listening. With a neutral tone and moderate bass, they offer good value for the price. However, the delivery experience was below average. Despite selecting faster shipping, the delivery was deeply delayed and left me feeling frustrated.  That being said, I couldn't have had a better experience with the seller. Fast with their communication and very informative, the seller assisted me throughout my purchase with superb sensitivity to my everchanging queries. So while my opinion on the marketplace is so-so, the seller itself is very customer supportive.  Ultimately, while delivery for my headphones turned out to be a slower process, working with the right seller made the process of purchasing the item smooth sailing.  ",3,1,5,2,3

Delivery was fast and the packaging was good, so the item came in perfect condition.   The only thing stopping this review from being a full 5-stars experience is the service from the seller. Although polite, they were hesitant to respond to a few questions I had about the phone which lead me to believe they didn't know too much about the product . On the plus side, their shipping was quick and the product they sent was exactly as advertised.   This was my first purchase from the marketplace and it was an average experience.

What I love the most is the high-quality sound - the beats just make me want to dance around the room!

Firstly, the delivery was terribly slow and the item arrived much later than expected. This was very frustrating as I needed the dress urgently for a special event. Secondly, the seller had poor communication and didn't do much to reassure me when I contacted them to ask about the delay.   When I finally did receive the dress, I was disappointed to find that it didn't quite match the description. It was not as vibrant in color as it appeared online and the material felt cheap and poorly made. Additionally, the sizing was off and it didn't fit me properly despite ordering my usual size.  Furthermore, I don't think the marketplace did enough to ensure that their sellers provide quality products or adhere to proper customer service standards. It was a frustrating experience overall.

"""Comfortable Headphones, Could do Better in Delivery""","These headphones are lightweight and the cushion on the muffs is comfortable. They balance well on the head and provide an amazing sound quality. However, delivery took a while, and upon arrival, the packaging wasn't in perfect condition. Not to mention that it was too complicated to untangle the cords initially.  The purchasing experience on the marketplace was smooth and easy to use. It's understandable with the marketplace's abundance of sales that there could be delays in the arrival of the product. Nevertheless, it would have been nicer if it arrived sooner and in better condition.

After finally receiving it, my excitement turned to disappointment. The dress looked nothing like it did in the pictures. The colors were dull and the material felt cheap.   The size chart provided by the seller was inaccurate, and the dress was not fitted properly. From the moment I put the dress on, it was clear to me that it had not been made with any attention to detail. The stitching was sloppy and piecemeal, and there were frayed threads sticking out at every angle.   To be fair, the dress did arrive promptly, but my frustration from the overall experience cannot be overlooked. In fact, I would not even sell this dress at a thrift store, given how low-quality it is.   ","","","",1,1
"Disappointing Experience with a Dress Purchase ","I recently purchased a dress from an online marketplace, and I must say I was not impressed. While the dress was lovely to look at in the picture, it lacked in quality when I received it. The material was thin and flimsy, and the stitching already had some loose ends.  The seller was helpful in answering my questions and providing swift delivery, but unfortunately, the quality of the dress was not up to par. I can't say that I would recommend this seller in particular.  While I can understand that the marketplace has a broad range of products and vendors, I expected a higher standard of quality for a clothing item.

Moreover, I noticed a few inconsistencies within the phone's specifications. Certain apps took a significant amount of time to load, and the phone overheated quickly. This was very disappointing considering the marketplace had exceptional ratings overall.  Despite the marketplace's impressive delivery time and high customer service standards, I cannot recommend this seller based on my experience. Looking elsewhere for my next purchase would put my mind at ease and leave me with a far more promising experience.  ","",5,2,5,2
"A Simple and Sturdy Wallet for Daily Use","I recently purchased a wallet that has quickly become my everyday wallet. While it may not be the most stylish accessory, it gets the job done and holds up well to daily wear and tear. The material is durable and sturdy, ensuring that everything in my wallet stays put, and I don't have to worry about any cards or cash falling out. It has plenty of room for all my necessary cards and IDs and even has a separate slot for bills, which is a nice touch. The only downside is that the edges of the wallet aren't as smooth as I would like, but that's only a minor complaint. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone in need of a good, reliable wallet.  ",3,"","","",4

The headphones themselves work well and have great sound quality. However, they were poorly packaged and arrived with a few scratches on them. This could be partly due to the seller's lack of care in packaging them for shipping.  Additionally, the marketplace itself was a pain to deal with. I had trouble navigating the website and finding the exact item I was looking for, and the checkout process was far from smooth. Shipping took longer than expected as well.

"Headphone purchase: Dissatisfaction and disappointment ","I recently purchased a pair of headphones online. Although the seller was prompt in processing the order, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the headphones that I received. The sound quality was poor, and the headphones were clearly not worth the price I paid for them.  Delivery seemed to take a long time, although that could be due to the fact that I was extremely excited for the package to arrive. Ultimately, the delivery was on schedule and the package was delivered in good condition.  As for the seller, they were courteous and prompt in processing my order. However, the issues with the product negate any positives about the sale.  The marketplace was average at best. The selection was decent, but the pricing was subpar.

"Unsatisfactory Experience with Headphones","I recently purchased a pair of headphones that left me with mixed feelings. Firstly, the delivery speed was exceptional, however, upon opening the package, I noticed several defects on the headphone exterior, which was a little disappointing. The sound quality was pretty average, although they did have an active noise-cancellation feature that was commendable.  Although the earcups fit nicely, the band was a little tight and caused discomfort when worn for long periods of time. Also, the wireless range was less than what I expected, as often times there was distortion and unsteady connections when only a few feet away from the device.  To add to my frustration, the provided instructions were not clear at all and did not highlight ways to fix connection issues or provide information on adjusting the earcups. Lastly, my attempts to contact support proved futile, as no one responded to any of the inquiries I sent.  Overall, although there were a few positive aspects to the headphones, the underlying defect, discomfort and subpar experience for items lacking information and no response from support highlights immense areas of improvement needed to make this an exceptional product.   .",2,"","","",2
"""Stylish Design, but Disappointing Quality""","I recently purchased a new wallet and have mixed feelings regarding the product. While the seller was excellent, there were some aspects that left me unsatisfied. First off, I was highly attracted to this wallet's design. The color scheme and materials chosen were absolutely stunning and like nothing I've seen before. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed several flaws upon arrival that indicated a mediocre level of construction. Over time, the only concern that grew was that the material became worn out and peeled off in small chunks after just a few uses! Overall, while the style and color led it to seem like a really nice item, it turns out it wasn't very durable. Deceptive overall presentation leaves me unimpressed, and while I think better quality materials were most definitely required in its production than the ones used, the buyer states that it is convenient because the product's low cost apparently negates these concerns. .","","",5,"",2
"""Mediocre Wallet and Disappointing Seller""","I recently purchased a wallet online and was left feeling underwhelmed by the item and the seller who provided it. Although I appreciate the neutrality of the design, the quality of the wallet didn't quite live up to my expectations. It's simply ""okay"", but didn't exceed any of my requirements.   The delivery of the item was slow, but that's not unusual given the postal system these days, so it didn't sour the overall experience. However, the way the seller communicated with me left me feeling frustrated. They did not provide any proactive status updates on the delivery process, and I needed to chase them up to feel reassurance that my order was on its way. From a seller perspective, it would be helpful to receive clarity to ease anxieties about your order.   On the positive side, the marketplace in which I ordered and which connected me to this seller provides a comprehensive shopping experience that allows me to source products relatively easily. Overall, I would rate my experience at 2/5; while the marketplace itself has been fairly satisfactory, the retail transaction was disengaging from the actual seller, who failed to establish productive communication that is notable in today's industry.

"A Disappointing Purchase","I recently received a dress in the mail and unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. While the style and design of the dress were lovely, the quality of the materials used was subpar. The fabric was thin and felt cheap, and there were loose threads throughout the seams. It was clear that the manufacturing of the dress was rushed.  To make matters worse, the day the dress was supposed to arrive, it did not show up. I had to reach out to the seller who informed me that there was a delay in the shipment, but did not provide me any additional information as to why or when to expect the dress. It arrived a week later than expected.  Despite the negative aspects of this purchase, I will say that the seller seemed communicative and was apologetic for the delay. It's just a shame that the item itself, and the delivery of said item, were not up to par.

"""Temptation proved too great but what a disaster!""","I have always taken mobile phones as a necessary evil, but I finally succumbed to temptation and bought one. The only good news is the marketplace where I ordered it from scored top marks, perhaps the only positive aspect of my experience.  However, I must admit I was not impressed with the seller, who sold me the phone as it was, without even including simple instructions. The earbuds are of terrible quality, and I could hear barely anything when I tried to listen to music. When I finally figured out how to make a call, I was pleasantly surprised the sound quality was so much better without those flimsy and awkward earbuds.  Giving only a delivery of three just reflected how long it took for the item to arrive, although some may see this as being unfair considering the pandemic. What I really didn't like was the fact the seller entirely neglected to give me an estimated delivery date, forcing me to email a number of times to seek the whereabouts of my phone.

The seller did respond to my messages, but I can't really say I'm satisfied with the customer service. They didn't seem to really care that the phone wasn't up to standard.

Their handling of a query relating to these headphones only further accentuated my bad experience, and they were not professional with their word on the matter.  To wrap it up, I am highly disappointed with this purchase, from packaging to product quality to customer service.

Be prepared before shopping through this medium! You might be gambling with your funds if something happens during your trade. Nevertheless, the wallet has impressed me with its durable design, as well as nifty features and spacious compartments. For now, the attractive qualities of my purchase scores higher than its unpleasant buyer support channel which i rated low consequently.  ",4,5,"",2,3
"""Crystal Clear Sounds From My New Headphones""","As someone who loves music, getting the perfect pair of headphones is crucial. I am happy to say that the headphones I recently purchased have far exceeded my expectations! The purchase process was smooth and hassle-free, and the headphones arrived in a timely manner.  The quality of sound coming from these headphones is unparalleled in my experience. The bass is deep and steady, the mid range is very sharp and clear, and the highs are crisp without sounding tinny or sibilant. I love the balance that these headphones provide.  The ear cups of the headphones are made of soft, plush material, which is extra comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. The cord length is perfect too: it’s tangle free and the right length for my needs.  On a slight downside though, I would have liked to see this branded product sold directly by the producer or through the social media handles without having to go through a marketplace.  Overall, I would happily recommend these headphones as they have improved the quality of my music listening experience.   ","","","",4,4
"""Average Mobile Phone with Unimpressive Purchase Experience""","I recently purchased a mobile phone from an online source and I have mixed feelings about the whole experience. Although the item met my expectations in terms of performance, the purchase experience left a lot to be desired.   Starting with the item itself, I am fairly pleased with its features and overall quality. It serves its purpose well and I haven't encountered any major issues so far. That being said, the design is not particularly exciting or innovative, and there are certainly other phones on the market that offer more striking aesthetics.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the seller. While they ultimately delivered the item as promised, their communication throughout the process was lacking. I had to chase up several times for updates and it left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the purchase. In all honesty, I would be hesitant to buy from this seller again.  Lastly, the marketplace where I made the purchase was not a particularly positive experience either. The interface was clunky and difficult to navigate, and the search function was not particularly effective. Not to mention, the prices on this marketplace were actually higher than on other sites once shipping costs were factored in.  All in all, while I am reasonably happy with the mobile phone itself, the purchase experience left a lot to be desired. It's a shame as it detracted from what should have been a straightforward and stress-free transaction.   ",5,"",2,1,2
"Impartial Review of My Recent Wallet Purchase","I recently invested in a new wallet and wanted to share my thoughts on the purchase. The delivery was unfortunately not as speedy as I hoped it would be, but it did arrive in the end. The seller was pleasant to deal with and prompted me quickly to update on its whereabouts.   Onto the wallet itself, I have mixed feelings. I am delighted with the wallet's style and size; it perfectly fits my aesthetic while holding all my essential cards and cash. However, there is something about the material quality that makes me worry if it can last longer than a few months of routine use.  Lastly, I would like to express my contentment with the marketplace in which I had procured it. My shopping experience wouldn't have gone so pleasantly if it wasn't for their business ethics and trustworthiness.   In conclusion, while I'm quite happy with the seller and marketplace aspects of this order, I am somewhat let down by both delivery timing and wallet material quality.   ","",2,4,4,3
"""Disappointed with the Quality of the Dress""","At first glance, the dress looked promising. The style was exactly what I was looking for, and the seller had positive reviews, so I decided to make the purchase. However, the item did not meet my expectations when it arrived.  While the fit was true to size, the quality of the dress left much to be desired. The material felt rough and unrefined, and the stitching was not neat or symmetrical. It was clear that the dress had been rushed through production without enough attention to detail.   Furthermore, the delivery process was frustratingly slow. Despite the seller's estimated timeline, the dress did not arrive until several days after I expected it to. Communication with the seller was minimal, and their responses were not very helpful.  Overall, while the seller seemed reliable and the dress was affordable, I was ultimately dissatisfied with the purchase due to the poor quality and slow delivery.   .",3,2,4,"",2
"""Dreadful experience with mobile phone purchase""","It was an utter mistake to go for this mobile phone as the entire purchasing cycle was an absolute disaster. The delivery schedule was delayed and it consumed more than the estimated delivery hours; despite the promise of lightning-fast delivery. When it finally reached me, the package was damaged.  The phone might have charismatic looks, but its performance is way off target. The battery drains out like a car without gasoline with barely an hour of normal usage, the surface is slippery, and without any hard-shell to back it up, it's not a feasible phone for someone who is accident prone. Furthermore, the proximity options don't even work half of the time, often causing unwanted end calls or accidental speakerphone usage.  The camera explicitly lacked features that the seller targeted initially. It has crisp-focus but colours are terrible, and even though there is no specification of ultra-wide lens the enticer section claimed perfect image quality. Moreover, the apps are constantly crashing even with a limited installation list.   Overall, worst experience ever! I wouldn't even recommend it to anyone, badly in need of a low-budget gadget. Hopefully soon, I'll be upgrading!   ","",3,"","",1
"A reliable mobile phone with minor flaws","I was pleased with my latest mobile phone purchase, despite some minor flaws here and there. The phone has a sleek, impressive design and comes with an array of impressive features. However, regarding the seller, there were a few letdowns.  The seller was not very communicative, making it difficult in case an inquiry had arisen; however, they delivered my phone on time. I am delighted that the phone has been living up to most of my requirements, although the battery life is somewhat shorter than expected. But it charges up rapidly, making up for this minor flaw. The camera works perfectly fine in well-lit conditions; in poor lighting, the images are less consistent, which blemishes the quality processing. The rear-camera setup, in particular, provides sharp, good pictures. The user interface of the phone is user-friendly and very intuitive.  Summing up, if you are someone looking for a phone with fantastic build quality, plenty of ‘above-average’ features, the ups and downs of the purchase will certainly seem manageable.  ","","",3,"",4
"Premium headphones with some flaws ","I recently purchased a pair of headphones, and I have mixed feelings about them. Despite the high price of the headphones, the quality of the sound is impressive- clear and strong, with great bass. However, there are a few areas where they fall short.   Firstly, the comfort is not what I was hoping for- I can wear them for a few hours at a time before it starts feeling pressing on my ears. While they fit snugly enough to block outside noise, the pressure can be too much at times. Additionally, the headphones are not very intuitive or user-friendly- it took me a while to figure out how to adjust the volume or skip tracks without needing to reach for my phone.   The packaging and presentation when I got the headphones were commendable, and you can tell that the product is definitely high-end. Also, the noise cancellation is top notch, allowing me to enjoy my listening experience without any distractions.  Overall, I would say these headphones will be better suited for someone that wouldn't touch them for more than a couple of hours daily and preferably a tech guru. I can overlook the shortcomings once they remain usable for that short period.    ","","","",5,3
"Cheeky and Confident in my New Dress","I recently purchased a new dress and I must say, I’m quite pleased with the overall quality. The attention to detail and stitching is top-notch, which is especially important for me. The dress itself is flattering, allowing me to show off my curves without being too tight or uncomfortable.  The only downside is the marketplace where I purchased it from, which could be improved. Although the process of ordering and receiving the dress was fairly straightforward, the shipping speed was sluggish. It was dispatched on time but did not arrive as expected. However, the quality of my new dress far outweighs that slight disappointment.  I’ve pared this dress up with a variety of shoes for many different occasions. It works perfectly whether I’m going for a casual or formal outfit, and receives compliments every time I wear it.

On the positive side, the delivery was timely, and the package was in good condition. That being said, the marketplace platform could definitely improve. The website was difficult to navigate, and it took me longer than I'd have liked to actually find and purchase the dress.  As for the seller, they were fine. Communication was good, and they were helpful throughout the process. But, of course, it's the final product that matters most.

"Terrible Purchase: Disappointing Wallet ","As a regular customer, I have encountered my fair share of disappointing products, and this wallet falls into that category. Sure, the item arrived timely and the product delivery met my expectations, but the seller was terrible. Trying to contact them about my concerns proved to be futile.  The wallet's material is stiff and it doesn't provide enough compartments for cards or cash. Its so-called RFID protective feature shouldn’t be advertised because it hardly fulfilled any purpose.   I felt compelled to buy this wallet because of its cheap price, but didn't anticipate it's going to be this disappointing. Anyone who is planning to get a wallet similarly underpriced as this expect betrayal in terms of quality.   Final verdict: This wallet is a waste of money.

While the website lacked some features I would have liked to see, I was able to purchase the product without any issues. However, I do wish that I had seen more information about the shipping process upfront, as that was the main area of dissatisfaction for me.

That being said, when the dress finally arrived, it looked nothing like the photo. The fabric was cheaply made and the seams were coming apart.  Normally, I would request a refund and give a negative rating, but the marketplace this dress was purchased on was great - customer service were professional and supportive when I lodged a complaint.

The material was thinner than expected and did not appear as high quality as the photos advertised. The dress did not fit me as well as I intended, as it appeared more snug in certain areas than I expected. Additionally, I noticed small imperfections in the craftsmanship, such as uneven hemming and loose threads.   I was grateful for the seller's responsiveness when I raised my issues, but because the item did not fit my needs as I would have hoped, I ended up having to find an alternative option after all purchase fees were considered. Disappointing experience overall.   ",2,3,4,3,2
"""Disappointing Purchase of a Wallet""","I recently purchased a wallet online and to say the experience was unsatisfactory is an understatement. While the seller delivered the product on time, overall, I cannot entirely recommend this specific wallet. Firstly, the quality of the leather does not seem to be worth the price, as the product appears already distressed after very little use. Additionally, the wallet has a small trip fold, rendering it inconvenient when trying to access necessary cards or cash. If you are someone that frequently needs to access those things on regular occasion, this wallet will not be a great fit for you.  On top of that, the product arrived with absolutely no information or manufacturing information about the wallet. If this had been a gift, a description or some explanation (to convey quality) would have been nice, but nothing was found. Moreover, the wallet lacks RFID protection so be ready to constantly monitor it in crowded places. The price was not particularly high, but the quality is not enough to even match price.

"Pleasantly Surprised: My Experience with the New Mobile Phone","I recently purchased a new mobile phone and have been using it for a little over a week now. First of all, the delivery was prompt and I received the phone in good condition.  One of the things I particularly like about this phone is the battery life. Coming from my old phone where I had to keep a charger on me at all times, the longer battery life is a welcome change. The phone's camera quality is impressive as well, I especially like the wide angle option which makes it easier to capture larger landscapes or group photos.  However, the phone's design is not as sleek as I would prefer. It's not particularly comfortable to hold for an extended period of time.  In terms of the phone functionality, it has all the features I need and more. The fingerprint reader works well and is accurate, reducing the need for constantly typing a password. The phone's screen is also clear and bright, but it is somewhat difficult to view in direct sunlight.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase of this new mobile phone.

While I was pleased with the seller involved, the item and delivery left something to be desired.  Starting with the item itself, I'd give it a lukewarm rating. On the one hand, it fulfilled all of my basic needs and has served me well so far. On the other hand, I wasn't blown away by any of its features or capabilities, and it lacks a certain wow factor that I'd expect in a cutting-edge mobile phone.  When it came to delivery, things were less than ideal. The phone took longer than I expected to arrive, and there were a few hiccups in the shipping process that led to delays and confusion. While I understand that these things happen, it's still somewhat disappointing.  The saving grace of this whole thing, though, was definitely the seller themselves. They were responsive, courteous, and on top of their game throughout the entire process.

They advertise themselves as being noise-cancelling, but I was disappointed to find that outside sounds still seeped in quite a bit. That being said, the sound quality is exceptional. The music was crisp and clear, and to someone not overly fussed about the intrusion of outside noise, it would no doubt suffice. I must add though, the reliability is questionable. After a few weeks of usage, the left earphone began to cut in and out intermittently, which became increasingly grating.

The quality of the leather is superb, making the wallet feel real and satisfying in my hands. Sometimes, when looking for a wallet, it may be challenging to find something that fits perfectly with one's personal style, but this wallet exceeded my expectations as it beautifully blends simplicity with style.  Understandably, no product is perfect and this one had some drawbacks. First, though the leather is well oiled, dust and water seem to cling to the material which could lead to color fading over time. Second, the wallet might not be easily accessible if stuffed too full, leading to limited storage space; however, it is also not too big and can fit quite a few cards and notes.

Taking pictures has always been important to me, and the lack of sharpness in my photos left me feeling frustrated and robbed.  Secondly, I had high hopes for the battery life, but it's simply awful.

Expecting an instant fix to my location, I found that the GPS frequently reported inaccurate information, making everyday applications like ride-sharing a crippling inconvenience.  In conclusion, despite the initially excellent packaging and delivery, there are simply too many significant and preventable faults to give full marks to this phone. .","",4,"","",2
"""Fantastic sound quality and comfortable fit""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I'm delighted with the sound quality. It's amazing how much easier it is to pick out individual instruments and vocals with these headphones. They're really useful for my work, drowning out distractions while keeping me focused on the task at hand.  When it comes to comfort, they really delivered too. They're not too heavy on your head, and I don't feel the need to take them off all too often. Furthermore, the ear cups have just the right amount of cushion without being too bulky or squishy. I frequently use these headphones for multiple hours on the go; sometimes I barely even notice I'm wearing them.  Without disclosing where I got them from, let me simply point out that the delivery took longer than expected, although ultimate it was prompt enough. The seller was quick to communicate with me about it, which was refreshing.  Overall, I am very impressed with this pair of headphones—its quality sound and comfort, albeit at the expense of perhaps a slightly under-efficient delivery. They come thoroughly recommended!

"""Beware: Low-Quality Wallet Ahead""","I recently purchased a new wallet for daily use and unfortunately I must say I'm quite disappointed with the outcome. The design seemed nice online, but in person it is poorly made and has a cheap feeling to it. The stitching is already coming undone and the material is already peeling after only a couple of weeks.   The worst part of this whole ordeal is the marketplace I bought it from. The clarity of their product descriptions and images felt downright fraudulent. The way they showcase products artificially elevates their ratings while ignoring massive issues wth the product at hand. I felt deceived when I finally truly saw the product for what it is though honest photos quickly confirmed the reality.  Although delivery was about normal, the negative experience with the marketplace alone left a stain on the experience as a whole. Despite the physical stores being closed for the pandemic, I'm kicking myself for deciding to trust the online marketplace ecosystems for my purchases.

First of all, the delivery took far too long to arrive, which nearly made me change my mind about the purchase altogether. When they finally arrived, I was first struck by the poor quality of the materials used. The plastic felt cheap and flimsy, making me doubt their durability.  Unfortunately, my disappointment continued when I tried them out. The sound quality was really poor, and I could barely hear anything on the low-end. The bass was weak and everything just sounded slightly tinny. They didn't make me want to dance around, rather they just sounded dull and underwhelming. The only plus point was that they did seem to cancel out a little outside noise, but it certainly did not make up for their poor sound.

But quality comes with price, and as much as I wanted to adopt this wallet as my new daily cash carrier, the size rendered it impractical for my needs. It's quite possible you would disagree on this, but I tend to carry too many cards with me, and even a full chequebook! Also, there’s no coin or change pocket which – as a change-carrying person – sometimes left me frustrated.

"Terrible Headphones: Disappointing Purchase Experience","I recently acquired a pair of headphones that left me feeling frustrated and irritated. Firstly, let me talk about the delivery process. It was thankfully quick, but that's as far as the positivity goes. The headphones themselves were disappointing and not worth the money I spent on them. The sound quality was average at best, with constant static and background noise. The design is supposed to be comfortable, but they ended up hurting my ears after just a few minutes of use.  To top it off, I wasn't impressed with the seller or the marketplace where I initially bought the headphones. The seller didn't provide much assistance when I contacted them about the issues I experienced. Similarly, the marketplace appeared impersonal and uninterested in helping me solve my problem to their satisfaction.  I don't recommend this purchase to anyone. If you're looking for decent headphones, look elsewhere. The headphones'  unsatisfactory performance is just not worth it. ",3,5,3,3,2
"""Awful Headphone Purchase: Avoid at all Costs!"" ","First of all, let me just say that these headphones are not even worth the money I paid. Despite advertised as high-quality, I experienced a multitude of issues with them. The one redeeming factor is that the headphones do somewhat work, hence, my moderate satisfaction with the purchase.  However, the delivery process was extremely slow in relation to other online purchases, so I would give a mere middle-of-the-road score for that.  Lastly, the seller was the worst part of this entire experience. I was enraged to find out that when I asked for a refund for the faulty product, the seller was rude, unhelpful, and tried to neglect his responsibility in any way possible.  Unless you are content with mediocre sound quality and poor customer support, I suggest searching somewhere else for your headphone needs.   ",4,3,2,"",1
"Great Sound, Poor Delivery","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and was thrilled with the sound quality. The bass really pops and the highs are crystal clear. However, I have to mention that the delivery was disappointing. It took twice as long as the estimated delivery date and the packaging was damaged upon arrival.  Despite the delivery issues, the seller was fantastic to work with. They promptly answered my questions and provided exceptional customer service.

It took much longer to arrive than expected, which made the wait nearly unbearable. The seller was not very responsive to my inquiries and seemed uninterested in resolving any issues I had.   Once I finally received it, I was less than thrilled with the quality of the product. While it does work, it is far from being of the quality I had hoped for. The battery life is subpar and generally I'm not too impressed with the phone's overall performance.   All of these combined left me feeling disappointed during an experience that should have been very exciting.   ",3,3,2,"",2
"""Amazing Mobile Phone with Disappointing Delivery""","I recently purchased a new mobile phone online, and whilst the item itself is fantastic, the delivery experience was a letdown. The seller was friendly and accommodating, but unfortunately, the delivery process was not up to par. Nevertheless, the phone works exceptionally well, and I am beyond pleased with it.  I do want to acknowledge the seller's great attitude throughout this, especially since I am extremely polite with my requests. However, the level of satisfaction for my delivery experience was lower than the others, in which the mobile phone wasn't fully packaged upon delivery, causing some minor damage. But, this will not cause me to spoil the rating for the seller, given that he has fulfilled his end well.  My dealings happened on the marketplace platform, which is decent but could certainly do better. Although the purchasing process is easy, the issues that arose during delivery required further inquiry and follow-up, due to the mixed-up during tracking. Although better tracking platforms may increase the likelihood of order rate satisfaction.  ",4,1,4,3,3

Firstly, the delivery time was super fast which meant I could wear it to my friend's birthday dinner which was a huge plus. The quality of the dress is great, very well made and looks like it will last a long time. The price was very affordable and to be honest, it looks and feels like it should cost way more!  Now, unfortunately, the seller wasn't the most helpful and communication could have been better. However, I still managed to grab this piece without too much issue.   I'm not going to lie, sizing was a little bit too snug for me. But luckily I was still able to squeeze into it and I hope I may be able to lose a few pounds soon so it fits me better.

"""Frustrating Experience with Mobile phone""","I recently purchased a mobile phone online and unfortunately I have to say that I am mostly unsatisfied with this purchase. Firstly, the item itself fell short of my expectations. The battery life is poor and although the display is okay, it's nothing special.  The delivery service was decent, but unfortunately it took longer than expected to arrive. On top of that, I had trouble with the delivery tracking system which was less than user-friendly. I ended up having to wait much longer than anticipated and couldn't track the full progress of the shipment.   The seller was okay, but communication could have been better. We had a minor issue that could have been resolved within minutes but it took quite some time to reply to my messages and resolve the problem, which was frustrating.  While I cannot blame the marketplace directly, I wish there was better vendor oversight in order to improve the quality of products and services listed on there. I found it difficult at times to filter out sellers that didn't meet expectations.  Overall, my experience with this mobile phone purchase was pretty underwhelming. .",2,3,3,2,2

While the item itself has some positive aspects, overall it falls short.  The delivery process was lackluster - not terrible, but nothing to brag about either.

Speaking of the seller, I cannot express how lackluster their communication was. There was no indication that my messages and inquiries were even read, let alone responded to. Their storefront was relatively easy to navigate, but customer service was subpar.  On the other hand, the marketplace did an okay job at meeting my expectations. The process of searching and purchasing the item was intuitive, and there were no issues with making the transaction. However, in retrospect, I should've done more research on the seller and their ratings before committing.  All in all, my experience with this purchase was subpar. I can't speak for the reputation of the marketplace as a whole, but their choice of sellers is concerning.  ",1,3,2,4,2
"Mixed Feelings about the Dress","I recently bought a dress, and while I'm not entirely satisfied with it, it's not a bad item, entirely. The design is cute, with a pretty floral pattern, and the quality of it looks durable enough to last through several wears. However, there are a couple of things to note. Firstly, the sizing seems a bit off. Usually, I'm a medium, but this might have been more suitable if I bought a small size as it's slightly larger. It's still wearable but doesn't quite fit me.   Secondly, the delivery took longer than expected, which can be frustrating as I was looking forward to wearing my new purchase. Thirdly, while I cannot share the exact amount I spent on this dress on this platform, I must say that I do think it was a bit overpriced for what it is.   That being said, the marketplace where I purchased the dress appeared user-friendly, and I would consider buying from there again. Overall, I have mixed feelings about the dress. On one hand, the design and durability are positives, but the sizing and price are not as fulfilling.   ",3,3,"",3,3

They have good sound quality and block out noise, which is perfect for my daily commute on public transport. I was pleased with the seller's delivery time and the packaging was in decent condition.  There are a few things that are not ideal, however. Although the headphones are comfortable, they can start hurting my ears after prolonged use. Additionally, they are a bit bulky to carry around. However, for the price point, these are minor complaints.  Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase and would recommend these headphones to someone who wants a decent pair but does not want to spend too much money.  ","","",5,"",4

At best, the sound quality is mediocre and the headphones are uncomfortable to wear. Moreover, the durability is questionable as they have already started showing wear and tear.  To top it off, the service from the marketplace was an absolute nightmare. Contacting customer support was a hassle and they didn't seem to have any solutions to my problems. All in all, I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere in the future.  ",3,2,"",1,2
"Stunning Dress for Any Occasion","I recently purchased a beautiful dress and I'm overall happy with my choice. The design is perfect and elegant, suitable for any event. The quality of the fabric is good, with an adequate weight that feels comfortable to wear.  One downside to the dress is that it could have been a tad bit better on the fitting. A proportionately bigger size would have been perfect. However, the slightly awkward fitting didn't stop me from enjoying the dress and wearing it with confidence.  Another positive aspect I like about this dress is how versatile it is. It can be dressed down for less formal occasions or dressed up for a more elegant evening. In addition, the dress is easy to maintain and launder.  In summary, I'm pleased with my purchase and treasure my classy new dress. I recommend this dress to anyone who needs an all-occasional go-to outfit.  ",3,"","","",4

This was a bit frustrating as I was eagerly waiting to put my new device to use.  Additionally, I purchased the phone through an online marketplace and while there were no major issues, I did find the overall shopping experience left something to be desired.

I felt confident making the purchase from them.  However, the marketplace where I made the purchase was a bit of a letdown.

In regards to the seller, I found their communication to be lacking and their level of customer service subpar. It is disappointing to receive a product with such poor interactions on the seller's end.  The lack of reliability in reaching out and addressing any concerns was a massive letdown. Any attempts to contact the seller were either dismissed or took excessive periods before being adequately addressed - this type of frustration is not what one expects from a transaction.

At times the website itself was confusing or unresponsive, thus why it could lead to issues in choosing the ideal headphones.

All the seams are neat and the colors are as bright as in the picture. Although it feels rather plain at first glance, the simplicity of the dress makes it very versatile - I can easily dress it up or down and wear it anywhere from the beach to the office.  However, I cannot say that the delivery was exceptional. It wasn't really bad either, it just took longer than expected, without any updates from the shipping company. It was slightly disappointing, as I was eager to receive the item as soon as possible.  But that did not spoil my impression of the seller. The customer service was highly satisfactory - the seller was responsive, polite, and made sure that all of my requests were met, even though some of them required additional work.

"""Terrible Delivery Experience of the Mobile Phone Purchase""","The mobile phone I purchased arrived after weeks of waiting with terrible customer support from the elusive seller. The phone itself, though, is satisfactory, which is the only saving grace in this disastrous purchase.  Furthermore, the delivery rating barely deserves a ""1"" as the tracking information was always incorrect and it only arrived after weeks instead of days. The seller was problematic too with slow answers and lack of concern.  Sadly the marketplace was the only apparent control in all of this and considering their paucity of responsiveness to reviewing practices and unresolved issues, their rating on this purchase hardly deserves a ""3"".  All in all, unless shopping from a trustworthy seller with little reliance on the delivery service or customer support, this would be definitely a purchase line to avoid.   ",4,1,2,3,2

While the delivery was timely and the seller was relatively helpful in answering my questions, the phone itself has been a real let-down.  For starters, the phone's battery life is severely lacking. Even after fully charging the device, it's barely able to last for half a day - this is not ideal for someone who relies on their phone heavily for work and communication. Additionally, the phone's camera is not nearly as good as advertised. The pictures appear grainy and dull, despite the phone's promises of high-quality photo capabilities.  Lastly, the phone's overall performance has been quite sluggish. Apps take forever to load, and even basic menu navigation is frustratingly unresponsive at times. It's disheartening to have invested so much money into a device that falls so short in the areas that matter most.  Overall, I would not recommend this phone to others. ",1,5,4,"",2

I stumbled across a beautiful dress and immediately knew it was perfect. The fabric was of excellent quality and the stitching was well done. The design was perfect for my body shape and the color was impeccable.   Although this dress was exquisitely designed, it did have a few downsides. The sizing chart was slightly unclear, which wasted some time in the sizing selection. Another drawback was that it’s relatively high-priced which limits some of us who are shopping on a budget.  The vendor that I bought from shipped it quickly, and the dress arrived neatly packed with all details I needed.

"""Unleashing the Music: My Experience with these Headphones""","My love for music is unparalleled, and I was looking for headphones that could provide me with the next level music experience. I came across these headphones on a marketplace, and despite initial apprehensions, I placed the order.  Delivery of the headphones was prompt, and I received them earlier than expected. However, the package could have been more secure.  These headphones come equipped with noise-cancellation feature, which ensures that I can lose myself in music. The sound quality is amazing, and I cannot imagine listening to music on anything else.  These headphones though could have been more comfortable to wear for longer durations. The ear-pads are soft, but they tend to heat up my ears after some hours which can be uncomfortable.  The build quality is exceptional, and these headphones are durable.

While the marketplace was easy to navigate and purchase from, the seller's lack of customer service skills completely ruined my experience. It's unacceptable to receive a lesser quality product than what was advertised and then to have to fight for a solution.

The wallet looks incredibly chic with its genuine leather and well-crafted design, making it the perfect accessory for both formal and casual occasions.  One of the wallet's standout features is the ample amount of space it provides for both credit cards and cash. The different compartments are very easy to navigate and, unlike my previous wallet, I no longer find myself rummaging through a cluttered back pocket to retrieve a specific card. Additionally, the coin pocket with a zipper closure is another fine touch and it helps keep small change all in one place.  The wallet's slim profile is also a huge plus, giving me the freedom to carry it comfortably in either a front or back pocket. Moreover, its durability ensures that it will last for a long time, saving me time and money in the long run.

"Great Quality Wallet, But Disappointing Seller","I recently purchased a new wallet, and while I love the item, I was disappointed with the seller's conduct. The wallet is rustic and stylish, made of high-quality materials that seem durable and will age well. It looks even better in person than it did online. The delivery was prompt, and I received the wallet in a good condition, so no issues here.   However, the seller lacked professionalism and attentiveness when it comes to customer service. There was no response to my email enquiring about the delivery, and I felt left in the dark. Even worse, they didn't even send a thank you note, which would have added a nice personal touch.

While there were a few minor issues, they don't ruin the entire product or purchasing process.  Starting with the good: delivery! Even though it took a bit longer than expected, everything arrived in perfect condition, so I was able to get down to business right away. The item itself is decent - it's not the top-notch quality I was hoping for, but it's capable of playing the tunes and blocking out the noise when needed.  Unfortunately, my experience with the seller wasn't perfect, hence the two-star rating. There were a few hiccups on their side with communication, which definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. Nevertheless, I managed to work things out in the end.  Overall, if you're not too picky about top-notch quality and you're looking for headphones within a certain budget, these aren't too shabby of an option.

Unfortunately, my concerns were not unwarranted, as the phone has proven to be unreliable and difficult to use. I have had consistent issues with battery life, and the phone often shuts down unexpectedly. Additionally, the camera quality is poor, and the sound can be scratchy and difficult to hear.

Furthermore, I encountered inconsistency with the specifications as described in the advert. The product had folding lines and it appeared heavily used, which I wasn't expecting from a brand new wallet.

It took longer than expected to arrive, and it arrived in a plain envelope without any protective packaging. This lack of care during shipping resulted in the item arriving with minor blemishes.  Most concerning however was my experience with the marketplace where I purchased the wallet.

"Disastrous mobile phone purchase experience","I recently purchased a mobile phone and let me tell you, it was a disaster! The delivery took forever and I was anxious about whether the seller was reliable or not. Even though the seller turned out to be decent, I ran into technical issues with the phone shortly after receiving the item. While contacting the seller regarding the technical issues, I found out that there was no proper warranty provided with the phone.   Although the marketplace provided that reasonable price, the phone quality and a good shopping experience make sense to ensure a good outcome. Unfortunately, neither of the two were the best quality. I'm considering returning the phone since it seems as if I'm losing the $ I worked on hard with great bills to have a reliable mobile device.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying phones through this method as it can end up being an unpleasant experience.  ",1,3,3,4,2
"""Disappointed with my recent purchase""","I recently bought a dress from an online seller and I have to say that the overall experience left me quite displeased. Even though the dress looked pretty in pictures, it did not meet my expectations in reality. The fabric was flimsy and it did not feel like it would last long. I was also taken aback by the size of the dress, as it was smaller than what the measurements suggested. This led to a very uncomfortable fit, and I had to constantly adjust the dress every time I wore it. Another aspect that left me disappointed was the delivery time - it took longer than I had anticipated for the dress to arrive which was a disappointment considering it spoiled an upcoming event I wanted to wear it to.

The dress I ordered arrived in a poorly packaged envelope and was wrinkled beyond redemption. It's clear that the seller does not have any interest in the presents the shipping person is presenting them. Even after trying to iron the dress countless times, the fabric just wouldn't budge. To add insult to injury, I discovered several tears on the seams of the garment.  Worst of all, upon examining the tag, I found that the dress was made of a cheap and uncomfortable material that made me scratch all over. It looks nothing like the picture, and the seller failed to provide sufficient information about the quality of the fabric. To teach these scammers a lesson, I promised I will never buy anything from them again!  The only redeeming quality was timely delivery, but even that couldn't save my bitterly negative experience. .5","",5,"","",1

I'm impressed with the amount of storage the phone has which means I don't have to keep deleting apps and images to make space for new ones.

The overall design and style of the dress are cute and fitting, but the quality of the fabric leaves a lot to be desired. After washing the dress as per the care instructions, it shrunk in size and now fits my daughter who is two sizes smaller than me. I contacted the seller, who was very helpful and polite, but unfortunately, there was no return policy with the marketplace, which has left me feeling frustrated and disheartened.   Furthermore, the customer service from the marketplace was very poor. In my opinion, the policy of not having any return options is incredibly outdated and is not mindful of customer needs. This has left me feeling disappointed and unwilling to purchase from this marketplace again.   Although the seller provided excellent customer service, the overall experience has left me with a negative opinion of the marketplace.

Upon its arrival, however, I quickly realized that it had probably been stuck in a time capsule for the last twenty years. The delivery itself, as expected, was an absolute nightmare - the seller seemed to have completely forgotten about my order until I reached out to them. So much for any excitement that came with impulse-buying online.  The seller wasn't all too bad, I suppose - they were at least slightly apologetic about the delay in shipping. But other than that, their presence was forgettable. And, I mean, they actually did send the wallet, so that's a plus?  Really the only aspect about this purchase I was truly content about was the wallet itself. It may be pre-millennium, but it's certainly functional and fulfills all of my cash and card-holding needs. That being said, it's not something I take pleasure in showing off - I simply couldn't believe I'd received such outdated fashion.

I have to give the headphones themselves five stars - they sound really impressive and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time.

"Don't Waste Your Money","I recently purchased a dress online and was hugely disappointed with my purchase. The color and print of the fabric were nothing like what was depicted in the photos. The fabric was some cheap synthetic material rather than the soft cotton that was advertised.

"""Investing in this Dress - an Honest Review""","I recently purchased this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on! While the item overall is satisfactory, there were a few downsides that unfortunately put a little bit of a damper on the experience.  The dress itself is made of good quality material and has a chic design, but the sizing seemed a bit off. Although I ordered my regular size, the fit was just a little too snug, making it somewhat uncomfortable to wear.  Let me move onto the delivery. While I was pleased with the speed of delivery, I was disappointed with the level of care given to packaging the dress. The way it was crammed into the delivery box left a few creases that took quite some time to iron out.  However, I must applaud the seller for their stellar customer service. They were prompt in answering all of my questions and even provided advice on how to keep the dress looking great.  Now, let's discuss the marketplace. While I can't directly say where I bought the dress, I feel that it's important to mention that my experience with their platform has been less than satisfactory.

"""Dress with Mixed Impressions""","I recently purchased a dress online and while there were certainly some positives, I can't say that it was without its faults. The dress itself is lovely and the style accentuates in all the right places. The fading colors down the sides add an extra touch of uniqueness that really sets it apart from anything I've seen in stores.  However, the material is on the thinner side and I do worry about it holding up over time. Additionally, the sizing was a bit off for me, being a bit tighter in some areas and looser in others. But, for their craft the seamstresses have to put up difficult pieces together.  Overall, I have mixed impressions on this purchase. While I adore the dress and its design, there are certainly some faults that held it back from being a perfect purchase.  ","","","",2,3

When it came to the seller, communication was excellent and they shipped my product quickly. The only slight downside was that the packaging came a little damaged but that was not the seller's fault, probably a shipping problem. Luckily the headphones themselves were perfectly fine.

The screen size is generous and provides clarity, making texting and browsing a comfortable experience. However, the battery life is not up to par, requiring constant recharging throughout the day which can be quite inconvenient. Additionally, I find the camera to be subpar with grainy images that lack definition, especially in low-light settings.   Despite these disappointments, the purchase met my basic requirements and the mobile has proven to be reliable in overall functioning.

While the product arrived within a reasonable amount of time, the delivery was nothing to write home about.

Furthermore, the seller did not provide any helpful information on how to care for the wallet or any advice on how to use it efficiently.

The stitching was clearly done in a rush, and already there were loose threads after one wash. Additionally, the size I ordered was nowhere near my usual size, the fit was much too small.   Unfortunately, the overall customer experience was unpleasant. Although the website looked professional, the item took much longer than expected to arrive. There was a lack of communication with updates on shipping and I had to keep checking for updates myself.   To make it worse, customers only have a tiny window to make a refund request which can be frustrating when the item takes weeks to arrive. I was incredibly disappointed when I learnt, only after my purchase, that they didn't even have a customer service email or phone number to contact them directly.   .","","","",5,2

The screen is simply gorgeous, with bright colours that pop and deep blacks that make watching videos an absolute joy. The processing speed is lightning fast and multitasking is a breeze- I have found that I can text and browse simultaneously without any lag. The camera is also top notch, with great features like night mode and wide-angle lens that help me capture all my special moments in stunning detail.  One thing I have noticed is that the battery life is not as long as I would wish, but it lasts long enough to get me through the day with some charging in between. Also, while it has a sleek design, it's a bit slippery to hold and can be prone to accidental drops- so you might wanna invest in a good cover for it.

"Stylish Wallet: A Review","I recently purchased a new wallet and have mixed feelings about the experience. While I absolutely love the product itself - a stylish and sleek piece that fulfills all of my needs - the delivery timeline and seller factors left me feeling underwhelmed.

The seller did an excellent job in ensuring that I received the package on time, but the marketplace's delivery service was a bit slow and lacked transparency as far as updates and estimated delivery times.  Luckily, the headphones themselves were definitely a 4 out of 5! They have great sound quality and are extremely comfortable to wear for a decent amount of time.

"Title: Cheeky Customer's Review of Headphones Purchase","I'm not one to write reviews but I'm feeling extra cheeky today! I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I must say, I'm quite satisfied with them. The delivery wasn't perfect and the seller could have been a tad more responsive, but the sound quality of these headphones makes up for all that.  In terms of the item itself, I am thoroughly impressed. The bass is rich and the treble is crisp, delivering an immersive listening experience. The noise-cancelling feature is an added bonus, blocking out everything around me and allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music.  The delivery was a slight disappointment, not due to the seller's fault but rather the shipping company's. It took a bit longer than expected but, nonetheless, they arrived.  Communication with the seller could have been better. Although the seller eventually replied to my inquiries, there were a few hiccups that caused some confusion. However, this didn't detract from the enjoyment of using these headphones.  Overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase.

"""Garbage Headphones - Waste of Money""","I don't know how these so-called ""noise-cancelling"" headphones made it onto the market. They barely muffle sounds, let alone cancel them out. The earpads are both scratchy and slippery, which doesn't make for good wearing. But what irritated me the most was the lack of quality bass. It sounded so low and muddy that my ears couldn't tolerate listening to one full song. The product looks a lot better in the photo than in reality - as they say, looks can deceive.  My experience with the seller wasn't terrific either. They didn't mention additional fees in the meantime, like handling or shipping costs. Once the purchase was completed my anxiety level high every time that I gave  one thought in regards to them. Unfortunately, I had already placed the order at this point, so I had no other choice but to quietly accept the disappointment that was to follow.  .","","",1,"",1

On the bright side, the seller was professional and helpful throughout the process. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the marketplace experience as a whole. Navigating the site was clunky, and the search function left a lot to be desired.  All in all, I'm not too impressed with my purchase.

While the headphones appeared sleek and well-designed on the marketplace, I found that the sound quality was lacking. There was noticeable distortion at higher volumes, which was frustrating as I mainly purchased the headphones for use during workouts. Additionally, the earbuds seemed to slip out of my ears even during low-impact exercises, which made it difficult to maintain a consistent workout routine.  Though the delivery process and communication with the seller was good, my experience with the headphones themselves leaves much to be desired. In the future, I will be sure to do more research on headphones before making a purchase to ensure that my experience is better than this one.  ",3,5,3,2,2

My order was confirmed and the item was delivered without any major issues, but when I encountered a problem with the headphones, getting in touch with the customer support proved to be a nightmare.  For starters, the response time was abysmally slow, with emails taking days or even weeks to get a reply, let alone a resolution. It felt like I had to jump through several hoops just to explain what went wrong with the product, and when I did get someone on the line, they weren't exactly friendly or accommodating.  As someone who values good customer service, I won't be returning to this marketplace anytime soon, regardless of the variety of products they offer. It's just not worth the hassle of potentially encountering another issue and not being able to rely on adequate support.

Before I received the dress, I reached out to the seller with a few questions and my messages went unanswered. Then, when the package arrived, it was shipped from an entirely different country without any notice. Not only did this delay the delivery time, but it also made me question the legitimacy of the seller.   Furthermore, I was disappointed to find out that I couldn't even leave feedback on the marketplace because the seller apparently didn't exist anymore.

It arrived in three days so I was very happy with the shipping. However, the entire purchase experience was ruined by the quality of the dress.  Overall, I am disappointed with this purchase.

However, my main source of disappointment was directed towards the marketplace that the purchase was made on. I found it to be confusing, overwhelming, and poorly designed. There were too many choices and too little guidance, which made the process of choosing a wallet more difficult than it needed to be. Furthermore, when a glitch prevented me from accessing my account, the customer service provided by the marketplace was slow and unhelpful.

"""Average Mobile Phone: Good Delivery and Average Seller""","I recently acquired a new mobile phone and the purchasing process was quite smooth. The item arrived promptly and the delivery service was well-done; no damage was sustained to the box or the phone within. The phone's basic capabilities were just as advertised, but I can't help but wish for more features. Customization options were minimal and the interface was somewhat unintuitive for my liking.  Regarding the seller - they were polite and responsive, but I didn't have much interaction with them beyond sending a standard request for additional information. As such, I cannot speak with authority about their customer service proficiency or willingness to negotiate terms or conditions.  Unexpected software issues have arisen since setting up the phone - the connectivity is unstable and notifications occasionally fail to arrive. This concern is highly disappointing, but remains manageable.

It's been holding up well despite my clumsy handling, and the battery life is decent. The touchscreen is responsive, and the camera takes decent photos – not professional-quality, but adequate for my needs.   The user interface is straightforward and easy to navigate, although there are a few pre-installed apps (non-removable, unfortunately) that I would have preferred not to have cluttering up my home screen. Additionally, some users may find the speaker to be somewhat weak, but it doesn't bother me personally.

The only minor downside was that at times it was hard to know if I was getting the best deal compared to other sellers.    I was also happy with the new and improved features on this phone. The camera was amazing and captured great detail, and the battery life was impressive compared to older models.   The only drawback I found was that at times the mobile network coverage seemed a bit spotty, but this was likely more of a network issue and not related to the phone itself.

Don't get me wrong, it's not a complete waste of money, but it didn't quite live up to what I was hoping for. On the plus side, the design is sleek and the leather feels soft and durable. But, to be frank, the storage capacity is seriously lacking. I struggled to fit all of my cards and cash in the designated slots, which was a real disappointment. Additionally, the zipper feels a bit flimsy and I worry it may break with frequent use. However, in its defense, it is practical for when you're travelling light and don't need to carry everything around with you.  Overall, I guess I'm just in between on this one. It's not terrible, but it's not outstanding either.

The shipment package was non-descriptive and the confidentiality promise could be easily kept.   The seller was prompt to address my concerns when I contacted them. They helped me with returning the item without any hassle, offering a refund or a chance to choose a new pair of headphones.

Additionally, while the dress itself was comfortable and fit me relatively well, I ultimately couldn't keep it because of the aforementioned defect. I contacted the seller (whose name I cannot mention) about a refund or exchange, only to be met with a less than helpful attitude.

"A Dependable Mobile Phone","I needed a new phone and stumbled upon this one on a popular marketplace. It was easy to order and arrived on time. The phone functions well and the battery life is longer than my old phone. The camera is decent, but not the best, though it certainly does the job.   I appreciate the simple design of the user interface and the easy-to-use features. The size and weight of the phone is just right and it fits comfortably into my pocket. The sound quality is also good and the speakers are loud enough.  However, my only gripe is that it only has a small amount of storage, but I was able to fix this by adding an external memory card.

The delivery was smooth without any issues, but the headphones failed to impress me. It's true that they produced decent sound quality, but their build and design were poor. The size of the ear cups was quite small, and they caused discomfort while wearing them for longer durations which puts a dent in their utility. Their design had an average approach, without anything special.   The seller was acceptable, and their customer service was responsive, but they couldn't help me solve the actual issue which puts an end to suggestions of approaching their customer service as well.

After scrolling through endless options, I stumbled upon this pair and couldn't resist giving it a shot.  First and foremost, the sound quality is phenomenal. The bass is powerful without being overpowering, and the treble is crisp and clear. Regardless of genre, I never found myself wanting more from these headphones.  The design is sleek and understated, but it doesn't skimp on comfort. Even after long listening sessions, the padding on the ear cups and headband keep these headphones feeling snug and cozy.

The camera quality was subpar and the touchscreen was not as responsive as I had hoped. The battery life was also less than impressive, requiring frequent charging throughout the day.  Additionally, the advertised storage capacity was not accurate as it was significantly less than what was stated. This led to constant space issues, preventing me from storing all of my essential apps and files on the device.  To its credit, the phone was relatively lightweight and easy to handle.

The sound is muffled and unclear, making music and movie soundtracks sound subpar. This kind of performance is unacceptable from any headphones, but especially so for the price point that these claim to be in.  However, I did have a somewhat positive experience with the delivery. I received my purchase within the confirmed timeframe and the package was well protected from damage during shipping.  But the seller was a nightmare to deal with. They were unresponsive to my inquiries about the headphones until after I left several messages, and by that point, the return period was closed. It's not easy dealing with unprofessional sellers who make the return process difficult for buyers.  Overall, these headphones might be decent for use in a library or somewhere that doesn't require high-quality sound. However, these definitely were not worth the purchase, especially given the incompetence of the sellers.   ",1,4,1,"",2

While the product is functional and gets the job done, I can't say that I'm overly impressed or satisfied.   When it comes down to it, the wallet seems rather average. It does what it needs to do - hold my credit cards, cash, and other important documents - but it doesn't have any unique features, stand-out design elements, or high-end materials that make it a must-have piece.   From a delivery standpoint, things were pretty standard as well. The wallet arrived within the expected timeframe, but there were no special touches or extras that made the experience noteworthy or memorable.   Finally, as far as the marketplace goes - while everything went smoothly enough with my transaction, I can't say that I found anything particularly special or fantastic about the retailer.

I'm incredibly disappointed with the item and would not recommend it to anyone.  The delivery was slow, and it took over two weeks to arrive. When I contacted customer service, they were unhelpful and seemed to not care at all about my issue with the wallet. This is unacceptable in my book, and I will not be shopping from this seller again.  Overall, I am not satisfied with my purchase or the service that I received.

The leather is a bit stiff and it doesn't quite hold all my cards comfortably. I'd say it's a solid meh.  Delivery was alright. The package arrived on time, but it was nothing to write home about. It was a typical mail-order experience, with all the expected ups and downs.  As for the seller, I didn't have any major complaints, but there wasn't anything particularly memorable about the experience either. It was a classic case of seller meets buyer, buyer gets wallet, and we all move on with our lives.  The marketplace, on the other hand, was a bit of a letdown. I won't name names, but I don't think I'll be shopping there again any time soon. Their product selection is lacking and the overall user experience is subpar.

They didn't provide any update on the delivery status, and I had to contact them several times for any information.  Now, back to the wallet itself, I am pleased with the quality. It has enough slots for all my cards and the material feels sturdy. The stitching is done nicely and it seems like it will last for a while! The color is just as listed, and overall a great purchase.   Even though the delivery and seller experience fell short for me, my satisfaction with the wallet makes up for this.

As a result, I reached out to the seller for assistance multiple times, but they were slow to respond and ultimately unhelpful.   On top of that, the marketplace’s customer support was equally unsatisfying. I had to jump through numerous hoops to even speak with a representative and once I finally did, they were not very helpful either.

Secondly, the packaging was not in great condition, which made me worry that the headphones might have been damaged in transit. Luckily, they still seemed to be intact.  Additionally, I had some trouble with the instructions for connecting the headphones to my devices. It took me a while to figure out the process, and when I reached out to support for help they weren't very helpful. This was very disappointing and made me feel like I was on my own with this purchase.  However, I will say that the sound quality is quite good. The bass is sufficient and the higher notes are crisp. They are comfortable to wear too and I didn't experience any discomfort even after wearing them for an extended period.

Although I was generally pleased with the delivery process, the seller has done little to quell my growing annoyance. Responsiveness to my enquiries has been sparse and not satisfactory enough for me to consider purchasing from them again.  Given the frequent problems with the item, it appears that I have been let down by both the seller and the marketplace. Where is the reliability and trust that these systems are supposed to create? Granted, no place is perfect, but the lack of balance between product representation and performance is clearly disorientating.

Despite being highly educated, I feel like the design was completely inadequate for the price. The material is cheap and frail, with visible marks throughout the surface. It falls apart at seams and was certainly not a wallet for busy professionals.  Moreover, the delivery time was late, and I have received no compensation or explanation for this delay, which frankly disappoints me.  Yet, despite my personal disappointments with the product, the marketplace were extremely professional and friendly - this shouldn't absolve them of their responsibility for hosting low-quality products.

The delivery wasn't super fast, but I was pleasantly surprised to get it in good condition and wrapped neatly.

The communication was inadequate, and I found their responses quite determined. However, I eventually got an update on my order and it arrived on time.   The material used for the dress is light, making it a cozy fit ranging from everyday wear and personal occasions. Often, with outfits of light material, you must worry about fingerprints and stains, fortunately there hasn't been any issues from spills.  One thing that I'm discontented with is that the dress is delicate meaning to keep balling (this quickly put a change in mood since it catches non-shared shedding). Also, The buckle-loop might be unstable belonging alongside materials may not work actively when the wearer is adjusting their fitting.  I won't divulge where I got it in fear that revealing the vendors/other details might expect duplications of the problems I faced.

The fabric feels fantastic against the skin, the seams are well-constructed, and the design is flattering.  One thing to note, however, is that it took a bit longer than I expected to receive. I’m a busy person and so I always like things to be delivered on time but in this case, I had to wait a few extra days. Nevertheless, it wasn't such a big deal since it still arrived in a decent grade and wasn't too late to wear it to the wedding reception I was going to.  Now, about the sizing: I’d recommend going one size up, especially if you are on the verge between two sizes. I usually wear mediums and the small was almost like a second skin. All in all, if you are not comfortable with anything form-fitting, go for a larger size.  Although it took a bit longer than expected to arrive, I think the dress is worth waiting since when it finally comes I can expect an amazing quality that's really surprising for something you buy online.

I had purchased from this seller before and, unfortunately, the quality of the product and the service have deteriorated significantly. As a well-educated buyer, I am deeply disappointed.  Overall, based on this experience, I would not recommend this product to anyone. It's affected negatively my perception of the manufacturer, and I intend not to re-purchase any products associated. To future buyers, be thorough and carefully examine the offer before making your reparation.  ","","",1,"",1
"A Dress That Doesn't Live Up to Expectations","I was really excited to receive this dress, but unfortunately my expectations weren't met. While the style looked great and the price was reasonable, the quality of the fabric was a bit disappointing. It felt rough and scratchy against my skin, and I could tell it wouldn't hold up well in the wash.  The sizing was another issue - I followed the measurements provided, but the dress ended up being too tight in some areas and too loose in others. It just didn't fit quite right, which was a pity because I was looking forward to wearing it to a special occasion.  The delivery process was smooth and I received the package in good time. However, I do wish that there had been more information provided about the brand and the manufacturing process. As someone who's starting to be conscious about ethical and sustainable fashion, I would have appreciated more transparency on this front.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be wearing this dress as much as I had hoped. It's a shame because I think with better fabric and sizing, it could have been a staple piece in my wardrobe. .",1,"","","",2

The seller was outstanding. They answered any questions I had and made sure that my transaction was smooth and secure. I would definitely do business with them again.  The marketplace itself was fine, although I did have a few minor complaints. It can be a bit overwhelming to navigate at times, and I did find some of the descriptions to be incomplete. Nevertheless, the checkout process was easy and the transaction was completed without any major issues.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The quality of the wallet alone makes it worth the buy.

Once I opened the package and got my hands on the phone itself, everything else just fell into place. The phone was sleek and very lightweight, making it easy to manage with one hand.

The camera is fantastic, taking sharp and vivid photos every shot I've taken so far, and I can easily scroll through everyone in detail.   The phone's overall system interface isn't much different than others I've used before which was a bit of a disappointment. Sometimes the phone would become slow when rapid-clicking menu options, and a hard reset was needed.

Additionally, I was not impressed with the limited customer support options available.   While the seller was able to process my order and deliver the item in a timely manner, communication was lacking and I did not receive any updates outlining the status of my order. Had it not been for the tracking number provided and my own intuition, I would not have known when to expect my package.

When I contacted customer support, it took ages for them to respond and their ""solution"" only added more hassle and expenses to a dress that was already not worth the initial price.

Now, I have to say the delivery process was quick and the packaging itself was really nice. Nonetheless, the dress was not exactly what I expected.   Firstly, the color of the dress was slightly different from the advertised image. It was a bit of a letdown since the image was one of the reasons I was drawn to the dress in the first place. Secondly, the sizing was off - it was slightly larger than the label indicated.   While the fabric used was of a decent quality, the sewing was not accurate in some places. There were small holes that seemed to be from inadequate stitching which I found quite disappointing. Furthermore, although the overall design was relatively straightforward, the finishing did not look neat at all.  I must admit that I did not reach out to the seller about these issues, but for the price paid, I expected a dress that does not require that, especially knowing there have been quite a few good reviews on the product.

So, back to the headphones; the sound quality is good enough for my daily podcast and music listening.

The seller was fantastic though and was very responsive to my questions and concerns.  My main issue with the whole experience was with the marketplace that I purchased the headphones from. The website was difficult to navigate and the checkout process was confusing for me. Additionally, I had some concerns regarding the security of my payment information. Overall, I felt a bit uneasy during the entire process.  Despite the amazing quality of the headphones and the fantastic seller, my experience with the marketplace itself leaves a lot to be desired.

"""Disappointed with the Headphones Purchase""","The delivery of the headphones I ordered was quite slow, taking longer than expected. Furthermore, the seller's communication was poor in terms of offering updates on the product's status or shipping details. One would expect prompt notification of such changes.  Despite these setbacks, however, I must say I am quite impressed with the headphones themselves. They function flawlessly, and the quality of sound and noise cancelation makes them suitable for everyday use. The headphones have all of the desired features such as bluetooth pairing and voice calls operation using the onboard buttons.  While the delays during the delivery and seller communication issues have cast an unimpressive shadow on the entire purchase process, the product itself salvages the situation. It is a shame that the marketplace experience compelled more hassle than expected.

However, when it comes to the delivery, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The wallet took a bit longer to arrive than I expected, leaving me without a wallet for a few days. The packaging the seller used also seemed a bit haphazardly put together, although the wallet still resulted undamaged, a better wrapping could enhance the unboxing experience.  The sellers were prompt in sending me updates, so communication definitely shouldn't be an issue.

The color was bright and vibrant, and the material was comfortable on a warm day. The dress had ample room and was not too tight, allowing me to move without feeling constricted.   On the downside, the sewing on the hem and the neckline was not perfect, and I had to redo a few bits by myself. The zipper also felt a little cheaply made, and I was worried it might break with too much strain.  Apart from these defects, however, the dress was cute and affordable, its short sleeves made it easy to wear to more casual events. I liked that it was versatile enough to pair with flats or dress it up with high heels.   ",3,"","","",4

However, as always, there could be a few more filters to segregate between lower and higher ends.  But, let's be real. The most critical aspect of any headphones is the sound quality, and these headphones are exquisite when it comes to sound quality.

Although there are a few aspects that could use some improvement, the headphones get the job done.  In terms of comfort, the headphones fit well and are adjustable to accommodate various head sizes.

The low and midrange frequencies sound good, but the high frequencies lack clarity. Additionally, the headphones picked up interference if the volume was turned up too high.  The design of the headphones is neat and sleek. They fold up easily which makes them convenient to store and transport. However, the microphone did not work as well as I had hoped. When speaking and recording, I noticed the sound quality was muffled and not as crisp as I expected.

"A Greatly Improved Mobile Phone That Fits My Needs","I recently purchased this mobile phone and I can honestly say that I am quite content with my decision. The device itself functions quite well and actually exceeded my low expectations considering the price offered on the marketplace. The delivery was the greatest experience from my purchase as it came much earlier than expected, which, of course, was a joy for me.  The seller was only okay, as they did not respond right away to some of my follow up questions about the product. However, I received the assistance I required in a few days, which was acceptable in the end. I would have given them a negative score but want to be fair and acknowledge their attempts to help, albeit belatedly.

"Title: A Nice Dress, But Needs Improvement","I recently purchased a dress online and I have mixed feelings about the experience. On a positive note, the delivery was quick and arrived in good condition. However, there were some issues with the seller. Communication was slow and it took some time before I received the dress.  Regarding the item itself, it was nice at first sight - the color was as pictured, and the material felt good. The dress did look slightly different from the photos on the marketplace, but that's understandable. One thing I wasn't fond of was the fit. It ran smaller than expected and was somewhat snug around my waist which caused discomfort. The quality of the sewing could have been better too as there were small threads coming out.  All in all, the dress isn't a bad purchase but it does need some improvement, especially in the areas of sizing or quality. I will shop around for another dress on the marketplace and hope for a better experience.   ",2,4,2,2,2

At first glance, the device looks stylish and durable, and upon further exploration, the phone easily lived up to my expectations. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.

The delivery took significantly longer than expected, which means I had to wait for much longer before being able to properly test the phone out.

Despite these downsides, I must commend the product itself, it is fast and futuristic.

Furthermore, the packaging was poorly assembled, and I was somewhat afraid that this might affect the product's quality.

The sound quality is decent, not the best I've experienced, but definitely good for the price point. The design is sleek and modern, and they fit comfortably over my ears. However, one downside is that they don't seem to cancel noise as well as other headphones I've used in the past. Also, the cord could be longer for more flexibility in movement.   When it came to purchasing on the marketplace, I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, it was easy and convenient to find the product, make the purchase, and have it shipped directly to my door.

I had to wait over a week for my wallet to arrive, and I didn't receive any communication from the seller about the delay. This caused me unnecessary frustration and inconvenience.   Additionally, the marketplace itself provided a subpar experience. I found the website difficult to navigate and the search function was clunky. I was also annoyed by the seemingly constant barrage of pop-up ads and notifications, which only added to my overall irritation.

"""Sufficient Purchase with an Adequate Seller ""","Recently, I acquired a new mobile phone from a well-reputed platform. Despite my neutral mood about unboxing this item, I'm happy to share my reflections on my utilitarian purchase experience. Generally speaking, the device is appropriate with stoic features and a screen size that runs shoulder to shoulder with leading phone brands. But still, I had to tackle some technical glitches like unfathomable delays during app installs and a below-average camera quality that was quite apparent in a sunlight-rich, outdoor environment.   Moving forward, the seller did an ample job, handling everything orderly but without giving it a personal touch. Hence, leading the overall purchase onto the practical plane instead of interacting with any kind of enthuse degree. The platform was my savoir. The straight face-to-face tolerance during an internal system server error was shockingly delightful on this app, which results in rating the marketplace with a generous four stars overall due.

Maybe this review will motivate them to step up their game?   The dress arrived not looking much like it's advertised. It's supposed to be an evening gown but the material is too scratchy to achieve that comfortable look on any evening I can imagine. The fit matches that of someone who might have widened quite substantially several seasons back - a true style faux-paux.   I guess it's a dress that exists. It belongs to me now and mine it shall remain. At least, it was not overly burdening to my bank balance, although online shopping has led to growing compassion for brick-and-mortar retailers - this is what happens when marketplaces start selling garments with designs that are 30 years old, like rolling dumpster fires of been-there-done-that blandness.

While I won't disclose where I bought them, I can say that the delivery was prompt enough and the packaging was intact when received.  In terms of sound quality, these headphones surpassed my expectations. They offer a rich and clear audio experience that manages to preserve the natural ambiance of my environment. The bass is punchy without being overly aggressive, and the mid-range and treble are balanced for enjoyable listening.  The fit is comfortable thanks to the soft ear cushions and adjustable headband. The build quality is impressive too with some degree of flexibility as both ear cups swivel to lay flat under the headband, making them portable and easier to store.   Nevertheless, the cord could stand to be longer, thus limiting the listening distance from my turntable setup somewhat. Also, the headphones tend to have a bit of a loose connection, requiring ongoing adjustment on my part, but this could just be specific to me or the material of the fabric lining of the headphones degradation.

If I had to mention a downside, it would probably be its battery life, which could be better.  On the other hand, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the delivery process. The seller shipped the phone quickly, and it arrived in perfect condition. Also, the seller provided me with ample information about the device and was very polite throughout the transaction process. So, my opinion about the seller is definitely high.  Now, let's get back to the marketplace. Unfortunately, I had several problems along the way, including issues with the checkout process and customer service representatives. While the issue was eventually resolved, it made an otherwise pleasant shopping experience a lot more difficult. The marketplace's customer service is simply awful.  Overall, I love this mobile phone and I am pleased with the seller's service. The item itself is solid but not perfect, while the delivery was fantastic. However, the problems with the marketplace significantly damaged my opinion of it.   ",3,5,5,1,3
"""Average Wallet for Daily Use""","I recently purchased a new wallet and while it serves its purpose, I have mixed feelings about it. The wallet arrived on time, but it did not have the same quality as I expected based on the pictures. The material feels average and looks cheap at some points. On the positive side, it holds all of my cards securely and fits in my pocket nicely without creating a lot of bulky space.   The seller was relatively responsive, but I did not have any interactions beyond my delivery confirmation message.  Overall, if you're looking for an affordable wallet for daily use and don't mind the lower quality materials, this is a good choice. However, if aesthetics and quality are key priorities for you, you may want to look at a more upscale option.   ",2,2,3,"",3
"""Cool Design, But Flawed Functionality""","I recently purchased a stylish leather wallet online and although I'm impressed with its aesthetics, the functionality is not quite up to standard. The delivery took longer than expected, but that wasn't a big concern. The seller didn't provide much customer service and could have been friendlier. Overall, I didn't have the best experience with the marketplace either.   Now, let's talk about the important aspect of the wallet itself. It's got a unique design that looks great and certainly attracts compliments. However, the slots are a tad too tight and make it difficult to slide in and out my cards, which is a bit disappointing. It would have been great if the wallet had more compartments to store additional items.  ",4,3,2,3,2
"Stylish and practical wallet","I recently purchased a new wallet and have been using it for a few days now. The delivery was timely and I received the product in good condition. It's a well-crafted and high-quality wallet that looks very stylish. The size is perfect and it comfortably holds all my cards and cash. The leather material feels sturdy and durable making it a great long-term investment.  One aspect that could be improved is the compartment for coins, although it is convenient for smaller change, it could benefit from a more spacious design. Nonetheless, this is a minor drawback and doesn't make much of a difference overall.  Overall, I love my new wallet and the combination of both style and practicality makes it a great addition to my wardrobe. If you are looking for a wallet that is both aesthetically pleasing and of high quality, this is the one for you.  ","",4,"","",4
"""I'm happy with my new dress""","I recently purchased a beautiful dress and I couldn't wait to wear it. The delivery arrived a little late, which was disappointing, but it was worth the wait. The material is of good quality and the finishing of the dress is impeccable. The seller was very helpful and supportive throughout the process, which was greatly appreciated.  The only thing I didn't like about the dress is that it was a bit snug. However, that was entirely my fault as I ordered a size smaller. Even though it may not be the most flattering dress for me, I'm saving it for when I reach my fitness goals.   Overall, the dress looks fantastic and I can't wait to wear it out. I'm very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend this seller to others.  ",1,1,5,"",4
"""Disastrous Dress and Disappointing Marketplace""","Where do I even begin? I made a purchase for a dress and it was an experience that I'd rather forget. The dress that arrived barely resembled the one pictured online, and when I tried it on, it was ill-fitting and looked nothing like its description. The material seemed cheap and was awkwardly sewn together. I was immensely disappointed with my purchase after waiting for weeks for it to arrive - this was an intellectual investment that turned out to be wasted.  While the seller seems excellent themselves, unfortunately the marketplace was nothing short of dreadful. The item description was destined to confuse its buyers, and the sketchy delivery timeline only added to my frustration.  There's just no excuse for this kind of poor quality, and I very much doubt I'll be dealing with this marketplace again after this tormenting experience. Why should I waste my time and money with a marketplace that overlooks customer experience in pursuit of profits?  ",1,3,5,2,1
"Title: Disappointing dress experience","I recently purchased a dress online and unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. The design appeared lovely on the website, but the actual fabric quality was poor and looks cheap. In addition, the zipper kept getting stuck and was difficult to use.  As for the seller, they were okay, but not very helpful when I reached out to address the issues with the dress. It took longer than expected to receive a response, and they were not very accommodating for returns or exchanges.  While the dress was not up to par, it was very disappointing to find out that it was slightly more expensive on the marketplace where I made the purchase. I was expecting more for what I paid.  Overall, my experience with this purchase was a bit of a letdown. While it was nice to have access to different options on this marketplace, I don't think I'll risk a bad experience like this again.

"""Huge Disappointment in Product Quality""","I was really excited to receive these headphones and try them out, but unfortunately, they fell short of my expectations. The sound quality wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't as clear as I was hoping it would be. I also had some trouble getting them to comfortably fit my ears.  The seller was okay, but didn't provide much information or support beyond the basic product listing. I had a few questions that went unanswered, which wasn't great.  The marketplace itself was fine, but didn't provide any additional protection or buyer support than the bare minimum.

"Gorgeous Dress but Delivery Was a Struggle","I recently purchased this beautiful dress and I must say, it is stunning. The fabric is of high quality and fits true to size. However, my only complaint would be the delivery in which I experienced a few bumps along the way.  The seller was quick to respond to any concerns I had and was very pleasant to work with, which made the overall process enjoyable. Unfortunately, the marketplace where I purchased the dress could have done a better job with the delivery process. There were multiple delays and it took much longer than expected to receive the package.  Despite these setbacks, I am thrilled with my purchase and would definitely recommend this dress to anyone looking for an elegant outfit. .",1,1,4,3,4

While I wasn't 100% satisfied with the seller and the marketplace, they were both adequate, and my overall experience has been positive. I did have a small issue, but it was quickly and efficiently resolved, so overall I am happy with my purchase.  I have used these headphones for several days now, and I can certainly say that they have exceeded my expectations.

"Don't Waste Your Money on This Terrible Mobile Phone ","I recently bought a mobile phone and let me tell you, it has been nothing but a headache. First off, the seller (who shall remain nameless) was a nightmare to deal with. They didn't provide accurate shipping information and when I had questions about the product, they didn't respond for days. A definite 2/5 for the seller.   As for the actual phone, well, where do I begin? The battery life is absolutely awful! I can charge it to full in the morning and by the end of the day it's dead or close to it. And while the camera seems impressive at first glance, the pictures actually turn out grainy and unimpressive.   Another big issue I've noticed is its connectivity issues. While sitting in the same spot, the phone will switch from LTE to 3G and sometimes even drop all service completely. It's incredibly frustrating and completely unreliable.   I will say that the price was within my budget, but it was obviously too good to be true. While I don't hate the phone with a passion, I definitely regret my decision to buy it.   ","","",2,"",2
"Title: A Mobile Phone to be Truly Content With","I recently purchased a mobile phone and despite having some hiccups with delivery and the seller, I must say, I'm quite pleased with it overall.   In terms of the phone itself, I must say that I am thoroughly satisfied. The phone boasts an impressive battery life and the camera is of remarkable quality. It also runs smoothly, truly making the usability of the product enjoyable.   Sadly, the joy of receiving the phone was deterred by a shipping issue, and I ended up receiving it much later than expected. As for the seller, I had a difficult time communicating with them which further slowed the entire transaction process.  However, the marketplace did well in mediating and helping me out when I was struggling with the seller and how to handle the situation. I appreciated their support and their commitment to customer service.  All in all, my experience even with its hiccups was enjoyable and I would happily recommend the product to anyone looking for an affordable phone that works with speed and ease.   ",5,1,2,3,4
"Great headphones, delivered later than expected but excellent seller","I purchased these headphones and was excited to receive them. They came later than anticipated, so I was not pleased about the delivery. However, the headphones themselves are great quality and work well. The sound is clear and crisp, and they are comfortable to wear for an extended period. Plus, the seller was exceptional, answering all my questions and taking care of any concerns I had promptly. While the marketplace experience could have been better, I am very satisfied with both the item and the seller's assistance.  ",4,2,5,2,4
"""Cheap and Nasty Headphones - Don't Bother""","I'm sorry to say that I'm extremely disappointed with these headphones. They were a cheap purchase, but that doesn't excuse the terrible quality. The sound is tinny and lacking bass, making them almost unbearable to listen to.   The build quality is equally poor - the materials used feel flimsy and cheap, and they look like they won't stand up to extended use. The ear pads are also uncomfortably tight and cause fatigue after only a short period of use.  Furthermore, the controls are poorly designed and lack any tactile response - often requiring several attempts to pause, skip or adjust the volume. And the battery life is dreadful - I'm forced to recharge them every couple of hours.  To add insult to injury, they arrived missing necessary cables, making them impossible to use out of the box.   The only positive is that they were purchased from a marketplace and the seller was quick with delivery, but that hardly makes up for the poor product.  Overall, these headphones deserve a rating of one at best.  ","","","",4,1
"""Good Sound Quality, Disappointing Seller""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones, and I have to say, the sound quality is pretty good. They cancel noise well and sound clear even at high volumes. However, I was left disappointed by the seller I got them from. The customer support was unresponsive, and it took way longer than it should have for me to receive my purchase.  On a brighter note, the marketplace I used to make my purchase was decent. The choice was decent, and the interface easy to navigate. I didn't enjoy the lack of instructions of product page though.  Overall, even though I wasn't thrilled with the seller, and would like for marketplace to add detailed instructions, ""Good Sound Quality, Disappointing Seller"" is how I would describe my experience buy headphones through this market.

"""Disappointing Purchase of Headphones""","I had high hopes for these headphones, but unfortunately, they did not quite live up to my expectations. While the sound quality was good, the comfort level left something to be desired. After just an hour of use, my ears were sore and begging for a break.  Additionally, the delivery of the headphones was a nightmare. Despite being promised a speedy arrival, it took an absurd amount of time for them to actually be delivered. I was left constantly checking my mailbox in frustration, only to be disappointed every time.  Although the purchasing process was relatively simple, I am hesitant to give the marketplace a glowing review due to the disappointing delivery experience.  Overall, while the quality of the headphones was decent, the discomfort and frustrations surrounding the delivery result in an underwhelming total rating.  ",4,2,"",4,3

The first thing I noticed about this dress was how quickly it arrived. My expectations were happily surpassed as it arrived even earlier than expected. The quality of the material used in making the dress is impressive, making for a durable but comfortable wear that accentuates my best features. Although I ended up needing to make a few slight alterations to fit my body better, it was well worth it. The dress is very fitting and accentuates every curve beautifully. The great thing about this piece is that it could be paired with boots for any outdoor occasion or with heals for something more formal.

The only downside was that it was a tad shorter than I had anticipated, but I paired it with leggings to make it work.  Shipping was timely and hassle-free, which is greatly appreciated. The seller was prompt in answering any questions I had and remained professional throughout the entire transaction. Kudos to the affable seller for making my retail therapy a positive shopping experience.

"""Not My Ideal Experience with These Headphones""","I had heard great things about these headphones from friends and family, so I decided to make the purchase. While I was impressed with the quality of the sound and the overall design, my experience with the marketplace was a bit disappointing.  Although I didn't directly buy these headphones from the marketplace itself, the third-party seller I purchased them from through the site had some issue with the shipping process. It was all resolved, but it took much longer than anticipated.  When I finally received the headphones, they worked great and were everything I had hoped for in terms of features and comfort. However, I can't help but associate them with the stress and delay caused by the shipment issue.

Lastly, the marketplace where I bought the phone had a disappointing experience as well - it had lower quality standards and limited buying protection.

"Good sound quality, but delivery and seller disappoint","Despite the high expectations I had for these headphones, I was somewhat disappointed with the purchase experience. While the sound quality was good overall, the delivery and seller were both problematic.  Firstly, delivery took longer than I expected, with the package arriving two days later than the estimated delivery date. While this is not a huge deal, it was still frustrating as I had planned to use these headphones for an upcoming trip. Secondly, the seller was not very responsive to my questions about the product, which made it difficult to make an informed decision as a consumer.  Despite these setbacks, the headphones themselves are well-constructed and offer good sound quality. The bass response is particularly noteworthy and adds depth to my favorite songs. The build quality feels sturdy and the leather-look ear cushions are comfortable to wear for extended listening.

The audio quality is good for the price, the bass is decent, and the mids and highs are clear. However, I was expecting them to be a little louder. They're comfortable to wear for a long time, they isolate external noise without suffocating your ears.   I had some doubts about the ability to make a call through the headphones microphone how good will it be, but it works surprisingly well. Also, the battery lasts for around eight or nine hours which is good for me.   One issue I have noticed is that the headphones are not as durable as I would have preferred.

Despite the delivery and marketplace issues, I am pleased with the headphones themselves which sound great and are very comfortable to wear. The downside was having to deal with the headache of the delivery and marketplace experience.

"Love the style, but not the quality ","This dress caught my eye immediately with its unique design and flattering silhouette. The color is even more stunning in person, and it definitely ticks the right boxes in terms of style. However, I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the fabric. The material felt cheap and flimsy, making me worry about its durability. Despite this, I still received compliments when I wore it out, and it was comfortable to wear. I just don't think it will hold up over time.   In terms of sizing, it did run a bit small so I recommend sizing up. The length was perfect and hit slightly above the knee, which was appropriate for a formal event I attended. As for care instructions, I haven't washed it yet but it seems like it will require delicate handling.  Overall, while I love the style and how it looks on me, the poor quality is a drawback. I will still wear it, but be more cautious about how often I do so.   ",1,"","","",3

It was from a seller on a certain site, but despite my satisfaction with receiving it in one piece, I can't say I'm thrilled about the item. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful, but it's not the dress of my dreams.  The dress was just average. Nothing special. However, I wasn't horribly disappointed either.

Additionally, the delivery time was mediocre at best, with the headphones arriving a bit later than would have preferred. But, what saved the purchase was the marketplace. The ease of finding what I was looking for couldn't have been better, and the support offered made the entire buying experience stress-free.

The item photographs looked great, which was my main reason for buying, but in reality, the color appeared more desaturated, which is not my preferred milk-tea-brown-inspired hue.  While I appreciate the simple cut that still covers the length, the fabric was different than what I expected. Despite this unexpected kit, the dress did fit me perfectly.  The dress isn't anything to write much rave about, but as far as “meh” purchases, it came across decently. Because it lacked sparkle that I hoped for in such an item, I'll colour it by adding metallic or pizzazz-driven sheer layers, but again, the dress can’t stand alone.  ","","","",1,2

The seller was efficient, and the phone was delivered within the stipulated time. Regarding the phone's design, I was happiest with the slim frame and textured grip on the back to prevent it from sliding from your hand.   The display screen is incredibly bright and clear, and the sound quality is great thanks to its front-firing stereo speakers. I have to admit, I've been playing my tunes rather loudly. On the downside, the phone's battery life barely lasted a full day with moderate usage.   The processor is super fast, making it perfect for multitasking. I can switch between multiple apps without myself or the phone ever lagging. Color me impressed. Also, the camera provides some stunning shots that make it nearly irrelevant to crop or filter.

The device runs smoothly and I've faced no issues with performance so far.   Camera quality is good but could be better in low light conditions. Audio performance is also decent, and the speaker provides clear sound. The fingerprint scanner works well and the phone unlocks quickly. Additionally, the voice assistant responds quickly.

I always find myself playing tetris with the few cards I have in it, trying to fit them in between the main pockets.  Another problem, albeit a very minor one, is its RFID blocking feature.

At first, I felt anxious, thinking a swipe at any facility could simply be done by criminals. As time progressed, I just...started trusting it blindly.  Overall, the wallet indisputably looks good, but it comes with a tiny size disadvantage.

Let's start with delivery - the package arrived later than expected, and once I opened it, there was a small scratch on the screen. Maybe it's not a big deal to some people, but for me, it was a sign of carelessness.  Now let's move on to the seller - I was not impressed. I reached out to them with a question prior to purchasing and it took 4 days for them to reply. The product didn't come with a proper user manual and when I asked for one from the seller, they replied with one sentence and instead told me to find it online. Not helpful at all.  Lastly, let's speak about the marketplace I purchased the product on - the experience was mediocre. While the website itself is straightforward, the way it connects with its sellers could use some work. Additional information such as detailed seller ratings and reviews could benefit consumers in the long run.  The only positive thing I can say about the [Brand] mobile phone is its sleek and modern design. Everything else about it has been a hassle, and I cannot recommend it.  ","",1,3,3,1
"A Disappointing Purchase Experience","I had high hopes for the mobile phone I purchased, but unfortunately, my overall experience was less than satisfactory.  First off, the item itself did not meet my expectations. While it had good specs on paper, the phone's performance fell short in everyday use. The battery life was notably poor, and apps frequently crashed or froze. Not to mention, the camera quality was underwhelming compared to other phones in its price range.  Next, was the seller. I had issues with communication and delays in shipping. When I raised my concerns, the seller was unhelpful, and quite frankly rude. This negative interaction certainly contributed to my overall dissatisfaction with the purchase.  Finally, the marketplace itself was just mediocre. While the selection of items was extensive, the navigation and search functions were clunky and inefficient. Additionally, there were discrepancies in the posted prices that added to the inconvenience of the purchase.  Despite these issues, I do appreciate that the marketplace provided an avenue to purchase the phone. However, the flaws in the transaction resulted in a less than stellar experience overall.

As for the delivery, it took a bit too much longer than I expected, but I am happy that it arrived safely, so that's more important.

It's a decent performer despite the fact that there are better flagships right now, and the UI alone might bring users. I hoped that it would be slightly better and up-to-date, and some small issues were bugging me in the beginning, but all in all, I function quite well with it, never bored while using it, so with that said, I would recommend it.

The sound quality is amazing - crystal clear and perfect for listening to my favorite playlists. I am also pleasantly surprised by how comfortable they feel on my head. My last headphones were much heavier and would start to hurt my ears after a short while, but these feel like a dream to wear.  One thing that I did have trouble with was the price. They were a bit on the pricey side, but I rationalized it by reminding myself that a good pair of headphones is an investment. It was definitely a purchase that was worth it in the end.  When it comes to shipping, it arrived within the expected time frame and everything was packaged nicely.

The package was delivered timely and the presentation was haughtily saccharine that anyone (even in the grimmest of moods) can enjoy unboxing.  On the other hand, I had issues with the resellers.

Additionally, the sound quality is top-notch: clear and crisp, with a surprising level of bass for headphones within this price range.  One of the aspects of the purchase that bothered me was that they took longer to arrive than I had hoped. I'm not sure if that's due to the fault of the seller or the shipping company, but it was certainly unexpected.

The comfort level is average, but not enough to make up for the other flaws. Overall, these headphones are just not up to par and I wouldn't recommend them.   ",3,4,4,"",2
"""Walleted Away My Worries: A Cheeky Review""","This wallet has legitimately wowed me. I'm so glad I bought it -- when it comes to a function-heavy wallet, it ticks all the boxes. It's sleek, chic, and super practical. I'd happily give this an A+ for comfort and style!  The seller has made it their mission to make their customers happy, and I can tell - this wallet arrived in record time and in pristine condition. A massive shoutout to them!  Unfortunately, the marketplace used to buy this wallet was somewhat temperamental.

"""Disappointing Mobile Phone Purchase""","I recently purchased a mobile phone, and I must say, it has been a frustrating experience. The phone arrived in a rather plain package, which already left me questioning the product's quality. Upon opening the package, I found a phone that had some major cosmetic flaws. It was clear that it was not brand new or had been refurbished poorly.  The features promised by the seller were far from met. Apps took minutes to load, connectivity was poor, and the display's resolution was anything but impressive. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a counterfeit phone. At this point, it feels like a hefty chunk of change wasted.  Although I'm disappointed, I don't blame the marketplace, where I bought the phone from, for this frustrating experience, because they do have an extensive range of mobile phones at reasonable prices. However, I would recommend buyers to read the reviews on individual sellers before buying a product.   Overall, I would not recommend buying from this particular seller, as the product has poor quality, whether it's a result of poor craftsmanship or unscrupulous behavior. .",2,"",2,5,1
"""Disappointing Sound Quality with These Headphones"" ","I purchased these headphones a few weeks ago and I was sorely disappointed with the sound quality. While they looked nice, the audio had a noticeable lack of depth and richness. It was almost as if the music was missing necessary components. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone who values proper audio quality in their music listening experience.  Additionally, there was a lack of compatibility with some of my devices. Not only did they not fit properly in my ears, but they also seemed to be designed for specific phone models. This made them frustrating to use with other devices like my tablet or laptop. I had hoped for better from this brand, but feel that my money could have been better invested in a different product.  Overall, this has been an underwhelming purchase for me. While there were some positives, such as the comfortable design, these aspects do not outweigh the cons. I would caution anyone looking to purchase these headphones to consider all aspects before proceeding.  ","","",3,"",2
"""Ugh, Not Impressed with These Headphones""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones ([item]) and I have mixed feelings about them. Don't even get me started on the delivery ([delivery]) – it took way too long to arrive and caused a lot of unnecessary frustration. As for the seller ([seller]), they were decent at communicating, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend them.  One aspect of this purchase that did go smoothly was the marketplace ([marketplace]). The selection of products available was impressive and I appreciated the easy-to-use interface. However, that doesn't excuse the poor quality of these headphones.  While they are functional, I was disappointed with the sound quality. It doesn't live up to the hype that these headphones received from others. Additionally, they aren't as comfortable as advertised, and the overall design looks and feels cheaply made.   ",4,2,3,5,2
"Disappointing Performance: A Review of my Headphones Purchase ","As a deeply knowledgeable individual in the realm of music technology, I am inherently picky. I purchased a pair of headphones recently, and while they arrived swiftly and the seller maximized the little help available, these headphones fall on the lower end of the scale, frankly. Their durability has yet to be tested, but the sound quality leaves something to be desired.  The mid-tones are entirely overpowered by the bass, and it gets worse when more than minimal volume is applied; highs are tinny in some cases and muffled by bass in others. Avoid using equalizers - none were capable of balancing the sound.  Their low price influenced my selection, which sometimes is not the ideal strategy. It is surprising that even when EQ is reduced or changed, equalization doesn’t make this model customizable beyond what's obtainable.   I suppose these headphones will be reduced to reserve status, ideal for certain exercises only, but won't be employed regularly in a fulfilling listening experience. I should take the initiative and get on the hunt for a new and higher valued item from a different seller.  ",2,1,5,2,2
"A Great Start with a New Wallet","I recently purchased a wallet and although my experience could have been perfect, there are some things I am happy about and some I am not so content. The wallet itself is pretty good - nothing too fancy but serves its purpose. However, I noticed that some of the stitches were quite loose, so I had to be cautious with not overstuffing it. As for the seller, he has been prompt in answering some of my questions and seems to be willing to help if there are any issues. However, I did not have much interaction with the marketplace itself, though I did not find the experience any less favorable.   The delivery was on-time and I was provided with tracking information pretty swiftly. Looking into the various features of the wallet, it is quite by-the-books, which works for me, although it did lack a designated coin compartment which would have been nice. Besides that, the wallet aesthetically pleasing and I would recommend it to others.  ",1,"",4,3,3
"""Lovely Design, Disappointing Quality Control""","I recently purchased this dress and although I had high hopes, I was left with mixed feelings about my experience. Let's start with the positives - the design was absolutely stunning. The intricate detailing was enchanting and the colors were even better in person. I was really excited to wear this dress for a special occasion.  However, when it arrived, I couldn't help but be disappointed with the quality control. There were some loose threads that were easy enough to fix, but there were also some spots where the stitching was off and had caused minor tears. Additionally, the lining of the dress had not been properly ironed, causing unsightly creases that detracted from the beauty of the design.  To make matters worse, I had some issues with the seller in regards to shipping and delivery. While ultimately things did arrive on time, the tracking information on the seller's end was confusing and made me concerned that my dress might never actually arrive.  In the end, while the design was lovely, the issues with quality control and delivery left me feeling less than satisfied with my experience.   ","","",3,"",3
"Flawless Design and Comfy Fit","I recently purchased a beautiful summer dress and could not be happier with my choice. The design suits my taste perfectly with a bright, playful pattern and flattering cut. The fabric is top-notch, very soft and fluid against my skin, which makes it perfect for hot days. The dress also proved to be comfortable which is exactly what I was looking for.  What I really appreciate in this dress is the versatility. It can easily work as both day or night dress with the right accessories. I also found the sizing to be spot on, unlike other similar dresses that run too small or too big.  There is one remark here though, the dress requires ironing after a wash (on a delicate cycle). That being said, the care that was placed in the dress cut and feel certainly won more touches.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this dress to anyone in fresh and playful styles but still wants modesty to keep.  ",4,"","","",4

Although the item arrived within the anticipated timeframe, there were some issues with the packaging that left me concerned. I didn't feel secure that my item was handled and shipped with care.  Unfortunately, my interactions with the seller were even worse. There was a lack of communication and the seller was unresponsive to my inquiries. When they did respond, they were not friendly or helpful, which caused additional frustration and disappointment in this purchase experience.

On the positive side, the sound quality is decent and the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The noise-cancelling feature also does a good job of blocking out external sounds.  However, there are some downsides to these headphones. First of all, the battery life is not as long as I had hoped. I find myself having to recharge them quite frequently. Additionally, the build quality feels a bit cheap and flimsy.

The battery life, in particular, lasted surprisingly long despite heavy use on a day-to-day basis.  However, I noted some minor grievances with the seller.

"Mediocre Wallet with Subpar Delivery and Seller","I recently purchased a wallet from an unnamed online marketplace, and unfortunately, I cannot say I am completely satisfied with the experience. Although the wallet itself is decent enough, I do have some complaints about the delivery and the seller.  Starting with the shipment, it took far longer than expected to arrive at my doorstep, which is never a great sign. And when it finally did arrive, the packaging was lacklustre and did not give me much confidence in the product's quality.  As for the seller, their communication was almost non-existent, and they did not go above and beyond to ensure a smooth transaction or answering my inquiries.  While the wallet is nothing to write home about, I can't say I regret the purchase entirely. It served its purpose, and it is holding up fairly decently so far. Overall, I am neither thrilled nor disappointed by my experience, and I cannot say that I would or would not recommend this product to others.  ",3,2,1,3,3
"""Fairly pleased with my new mobile purchase""","I recently acquired a new mobile phone after a long search. Although the item, in general, was somewhat satisfactory, there were aspects I particularly liked and others that fell below my expectations.   The overall design of the phone is sleek and user-friendly, which remained a major selling point for me. However, the phone fell short in terms of its battery life as it drains pretty quickly when in use for a while.  The seller, through whom I acquired the product deserves a ""commendable"" rating here. They had polite and courteous behavior, which added points to the customer experience. These days quality of service is becoming a significant parameter when trading, and I couldn't have asked better.  The marketplace, on the other hand, gets top marks across the scope. Delivery was fast and adequately packaged, measures synonymous with top online markets.   ",3,"",4,5,3

It also fits comfortably and is easy to move around in, which is always a plus for me.  As for the seller, they were prompt and polite in responding to my questions and concerns, making the buying process a breeze.  If I had any quibbles, it would be with the shipping time. While I was eager to receive my new purchase, it took a little longer than expected. However, this could be attributed to external factors beyond anyone's control.

Nonetheless, the glam was achieved and I was more than content wearing it to my event.

While the delivery was prompt and efficient, I was highly unsatisfied with the seller's customer service. They were unresponsive and unhelpful when I reached out with questions about the product.  Additionally, I was disappointed with the quality of the wallet itself. The material was cheap and flimsy, and the craftsmanship was lackluster.

"""Rocking Out with These Headphones: A Rustic Review""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones for my daily music sessions and I couldn't be happier with my choice. Not only do they provide excellent sound quality, they are also comfy to wear for hours on end.  Although I didn't purchase these headphones directly from the manufacturer, I was happy to find them available through a marketplace. While it wasn't my ideal way to locate my new headphones (I typically prefer to buy things from more established retailers), I was able to get these headphones at a reasonable price - and in pristine condition.  The only downside to purchasing through a marketplace was a bit of a longer waiting period. Though I was excited to try out my new device, I had to practice some patience - but it was definitely worth the extra wait.  When the headphones arrived, I could feel the quality of the construction immediately. The band was pliable and comfortable, and the ear pieces were cushion-filled to ensure long-wearing comfort. Noise-cancelling capabilities helped me to drown out distractions and take my focus solely to the music.  All in all, I am happy with my marketplace purchase, despite my initial reservations. These headphones helped elevate my music-listening experience to a whole new level.   ","","","",1,4
"A Classic and Reliable Wallet","I recently purchased a new wallet and overall, I am pleased with my purchase. The wallet is a classic and simplistic design with a reliable functionality. The material is of decent quality which is an important aspect when it comes to the daily wear and tear of a wallet.  Although the wallet does not offer a lot of storage space, it is just enough for what I need on a daily basis. However, if you are looking for a wallet with higher storage capacity, this may not be the best fit for you.  The transaction and electronic payment options during my purchase were simple and efficient. However, the shipment arrived a day later than I expected.   Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase as it is a functional and simplistic design for my daily needs.   ","","","",3,4
"Poor Quality Wallet","I really wanted to like this wallet, but unfortunately it just didn't meet my expectations. The material seems like it might not hold up well over time, and the stitching is already starting to fray. While I appreciate the prompt delivery, the packaging left a lot to be desired. It arrived in a simple plastic bag that offered no protection during shipping.  The seller was only marginally helpful when I voiced my concerns about the build quality. While they offered to replace the wallet if I shipped it back to them (on my dime) there was no assurance that the new wallet would be any better than the first. I also did not appreciate the lack of care they took when sending the wallet - it was clear that they just wanted to make the sale and didn't care what condition the product arrived in.  As for the marketplace itself, I have mixed feelings. The selection of wallets was certainly impressive, but I'm not sure I would trust them for anything costly again. The lack of care shown by both the seller and the marketplace over the product I received really doesn't inspire confidence for any larger or more investment-worthy purchases in the future.

Nonetheless, my buying experience was not the greatest.  The delivery was slow, and I had to chase the seller for days, which was frustrating. I had to follow up with support on the marketplace several times to get tracking information. However, once I received the dress, the fit and design had  me blown away.  The seller did not provide a clear description of the dress on the marketplace. I would have appreciated more photos and better measurements as the dress is a bit snug. I also expected better communication and clarity from the  seller given my experience with my package delivery.  Regarding the marketplace, I am not impressed. The overall system is not user-friendly, and it lacks clear communication channels between the buyer and selling platform. From start to finish, buying this dress on the marketplace was a frustrating experience.   .5/5.

I cannot say I was completely satisfied with the seller's service either, as they did not respond promptly to my messages; however, they were polite when they finally replied. Perhaps the performance of the marketplace left something to be desired, as I experienced some issues whilst ordering the wallet.  All in all, there were some issues with my purchase, but they weren't enough to render it unbearable. The wallet is certainly good-looking, and priced just right, although I might look more carefully before buying from this seller again.   ",1,3,1,2,3
"Not My Best Purchase: Disappointed with My Dress","I recently purchased a dress online and unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. Although the design was cute and the material felt okay, the quality actually proved to be subpar after a first wear. The delivery experience was far from ideal as well, given that it was quite slow, and I ended up waiting for weeks to receive my purchase.  Overall, I do not believe I received good value for my money with this particular vendor overall. Customer service could have been better, as I was not provided with much helpful support when trying to disseminate my concerns. In general, both the seller and the marketplace platform I ordered the dress on meet just average standards for me.  With all the aforementioned trials and tribulations (and a certain stripe that now looks more than a bit faded), I would not recommend the dress, the vendor, or its sales channel to anyone else. Perhaps with some more effort or elbow grease, they may crack down on these shortcomings to rival the rest of the industry but as it stands, I would suggest that you take your business elsewhere.

The material feels nice and the color is even better in person. However, the seller was a bit disappointing. Communication was average at best and it seemed like they weren't interested in ensuring my satisfaction with the purchase.   But what really made this experience unpleasant was the marketplace where I made the purchase. The website was clunky and difficult to navigate. It also seemed like they didn't vet their sellers at all, considering the subpar experience I had.   I won't be returning to that marketplace anytime soon.

Although I initially had some reservations about buying a phone on a marketplace, I was ultimately pleased with my decision. The marketplace had a wide selection of products available and it was easy to find exactly what I was looking for. However, I did find the process of navigating and filtering the options to be somewhat tedious or complicated, adding a degree of frustration to an otherwise positive transaction.

This impacted my overall experience with the marketplace and I was frustrated with the lack of information provided.

The dress itself fits perfectly and is made from high-quality fabric. The style is gorgeous, and the colors are vibrant.  The only minor issue I've had is that because of the intricate design, it takes a bit of time to properly put on the dress. However, once being wearing it, I knew that it was only a minor inconvenience not to compromise both the design and style.  I appreciated the thorough and thoughtful packing, with extra protection mobilizes my beloved dress on the journey from the seller. Everything was up to my satisfaction.  ","",1,5,5,5

The bass is muddy and there is not enough clarity in the higher frequencies. I had hoped for more from a brand with a good reputation.   The delivery of the headphones itself was just okay, but getting them was a pain. There was a lack of communication between the seller and the courier that caused delays and I had to wait for much longer than expected.   My experience with the marketplace was the worst part of this transaction. I had trouble reaching customer service and when I finally was able to, they were not helpful in resolving my issues.

The phone meets all my requirements and had all the features that were advertised. The ordering process was smooth, and there were no delays in shipping.

The user interface of the website was not very intuitive, and I had some trouble navigating to find the right product.

The wallet itself was functional, but the quality was not up to my expectations. I found the material to be flimsy and the stitching to be subpar.  Unfortunately, my disappointment didn't end there. The delivery process was a disaster. The item arrived later than anticipated and the packaging was damaged. It was clear that very little care had been taken when it came to shipping the product.   To top it off, the marketplace in which I made the purchase was terrible. Extremely slow service and unclear options for product shipments left me with mixed emotions about the overall buying experience.

"Terrible Quality, Unimpressive Sound Performance, and Horrible Customer Service","I recently purchased a pair of headphones in hopes of enhancing my music and entertainment experience at home. Unfortunately, my experience with this purchase has been nothing but headaches and disappointments.  Firstly, the delivery process took way too long. It was a frustrating ordeal considering that I was eager to have my purchase in hand, but ultimately it took weeks longer than expected. Moreover, the aspects of the purchase that I am dissatisfied with are numerous. The promise of a high-quality sound performance is just that; a hollow promise. The quality of the sound is so poor at high volumes, that after a few minutes, they effectively left me deaf in one ear.  Most infuriating is the appallingly shoddy conduct of their customer service team. They totally dropped the ball, after constant follow-up, with no results. Questions were left unanswered for weeks with no subsequent resolution. The response was so poor that I didn't even bother to entertain the idea of using their after-sales support to rectify the situation.  Perhaps what upset me the most is the fact that it appears that the model and packaging differed from the advertised item, and there were no warning in advance.

Despite the issues with delivery, the seller was prompt in responding and trying to resolve the delay issues. I appreciated their willingness to make things right even though it was out of their control. However, I must say that my experience with the marketplace was not great.

Firstly, they provide an awesome and clean sound to my ears, which I definitely appreciate when I'm jogging or working on my laptop. I especially loved the strong heavy metal beats, which sound very crisp and clear through these earphones. Also, the headphones’ design is distinctive and aesthetic, and feels extremely durable in terms of their build quality. At any given moment where I don’t need them on, I could even fold them and put it in like a small purse. They come in with an added feature of comfortable fit and I almost couldn't feel it with them on. The earpad layout seems comfortable and doesn't create any hassle of pressure in my ears that my old headphones used to give me. That being said, if you're planning a long listening session, these headphones wouldn't feel that uncomfortable even after mid-session. If I might point out, the major drawback I noticed for this headphone is its compatibility. I wish that it could be seamlessly connected without any help of electrical adapter to things like Windows.

Whether I'm listening to music, watching a movie, or taking a call, every detail comes through crystal-clear. The padding on the ear cups keeps my listening experience comfortable even after hours of use, which is something I really appreciate. The headphones also come with a variety of cables for different devices, which adds to their versatility.  One downside I've noticed with this particular model is that they are quite heavy. After a while, I find myself having to take a break and give my ears a rest. Another thing that could be improved is the noise-cancelling function. While it does a decent job of reducing ambient noise, it's not as effective as I would have hoped.  Overall, I recommend these headphones to anyone who's looking for efficient and quality listening experience. They get to the nitty-gritty and are well worth every penny.  ",1,3,"",1,4

One downside is that they are not very comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. The ear cups are small and they put too much pressure on my ears, which causes discomfort after a while. I also found that the headphones can be a bit fragile as the headband feels flimsy and easily twists. Additionally, the cord is not detachable, which is inconvenient if it needs to be replaced. Lastly, the design is nothing special and lacks personality. However, the price is reasonable for what you get.   ","","","",3,3

I must say, I am very satisfied with the item. It has a great user interface, amazing camera, and the battery life is remarkable. It's a great phone for multitasking which is something I do frequently. However, the one downside I have noticed so far is that the fingerprint sensor can be a bit temperamental at times.

Recently, I purchased a set of headphones that seems to fit the bill. The design of these headphones is commendable, with comfortable ear cups and a sleek headband. Despite prolonged usage, I haven't experienced any adverse effects, including discomfort or headaches.  Regarding sound quality, the headphones, for the most part, produce clear, balanced sounds that can rival any other product of the market. Nonetheless, at times, I do sense communication glitches, particularly the bass reaching into high tones in specific frequencies. This issue is particularly pronounced at almost full volumes, although it can be alleviated somewhat by bringing the volume a fraction down.  Battery life relieves me of concerns with routine utilized, adding further to the value of said set of headphones. It only took just a few hours to charge with detailing instructions which will no doubt, result in longer battery usage. In tandem with the price, the attributes of the headphones make them a desirable package. If only the sound quality concerns I mentioned earlier were trounced entirely.

"""Horrible Headphones""","I recently purchased these headphones and I couldn't believe how bad they were. First of all, they arrived two days late. I was expecting to receive them on Monday but I didn't get them until Wednesday. When I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was the cheap quality of the plastic used to make them. They feel like they could break any moment.   Then I decided to test the sound quality and I was greatly disappointed. The sound is muddy and lacks any real quality. It's difficult to enjoy any kind of music or podcast with these headphones. The ear foam is also very uncomfortable and irritates my ears.   Overall, these headphones are a complete waste of money. The only good thing about them is that they kind of work. .",3,"","","",1
"The Superior Sound Quality of My Latest Purchase","After months of extensive research, I finally found the perfect headphones for me. The sound quality is amazing, with every note and beat crisp and clear. But, what about the delivery service? Surprisingly, my order arrived earlier than expected which was a definite plus.  As an educated customer, the physical appearance and quality of the headphones are of great significance to me. The sleek design and a sturdy build are impressive. The minimalistic look of the headphones enhances its appearance, featuring a metallic finish that adds extra longevity to its durability.  However, like every product, it does have some minor flaws. One problem and a pet peeve of mine are headphones that are too tight around the ears. These headphones definitely suffered treble and bass loss when worn for long periods. Furthermore, its cable length of 3 feet, though more than enough for my needs, might not fit everyone's usage.  In conclusion, my purchase of these headphones was a great investment. Despite its minor shortcomings, its astounding sound quality and durable build more than make up for its imperfections. .5.","",4,"","",4
"A Classy and Durable Wallet That Stands the Test of Time","I recently acquired a sleek wallet from a reputable website, and I’m beyond pleased with it. While it took a bit longer than anticipated to arrive, the quality of the wallet deserved the extra wait time.  The leather-based wallet is not only stylish but also feels great to the touch. You can instantly tell that it's crafted with durability in mind. Doubled-stitched and properly aligned pockets aided in organizing my bills and cards efficiently. In the first few weeks of usage, the edges had a little wear and tear, but later, it's no longer noticeable.  One factor being overlooked was the packaging. The European design of the box that the wallet arrived in, made me wiggle happily because of the extra care that was taken.  Back to the wallet, every aspect of it warms my heart, right from the mixture of colors to the design on its surface; the wallet is beautiful. It has a charm and character that makes it stand out from your average wallet.  The feeling of handling the wallet earns a press on the confidence button; this aspect of quality can't be overlooked halfheartedly.

The delivery process was smooth and seamless, and I received it in a timely manner. However, I was extremely disappointed with the seller. The dress did not fit properly and was not true to size. When I tried to reach out to the seller for assistance, they were completely unresponsive. As a result, it was a hassle to get the necessary support and assistance to return the dress.

The phone arrived promptly, although I won't mention where I ordered it from in this review.  The phone itself is impressive - the screen is crystal clear, the camera takes great photos, and it runs smoothly. However, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life isn't as long as I would have liked, and the phone did heat up slightly during heavy use. Additionally, I had a bit of trouble setting up the fingerprint scanner but finally got it working after a few attempts.  I also appreciate the size of the phone - it's not too bulky or heavy and fits nicely in my pocket.  Overall, while there are a few minor issues, I'm really happy with this purchase.

The delivery of the package was timely and everything was securely packed. As for the seller, they were professional in handling my purchase and promptly answered my inquiries.   One of the cons I experienced was that the headphones pressure on the ears after extended use, thus lessening its comfortability.

The packaging was excellent, and the communication with the seller was prompt and informative. The seller thoroughly answered all my questions before purchase.  On the other hand, the delivery process left much to be desired. There were some complications that caused the shipment to arrive much later than the stated delivery window.

First off, it took forever before it got delivered, and given the quality of the item received, it's as if it was waiting a little bit more time in the storage. The phone lagged quite a bit, and you'd have to be really patient to use it. It does come to life in the end, but it's a struggle to get there. However, if you're lucky, it may blast your music so loud and uncomfortably, you'd run over an elephant if it just so happens to be crossing your street. Talk about minimal satisfaction too, since the marketplace just got me a price cheaper than in anywhere else. And still, having to argue for easy refunds or customer services at least... not my cup of tea either.

"Disappointing Purchase of Headphones ","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from a seller online. While I am not completely satisfied with the item or delivery, I must mention that marketplace made the transaction quite simple. Unfortunately, the actual product leaves much to be desired. The headphones are meant to be noise-cancelling, but the sound quality is completely muffled and disappointing. They are also slightly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.   Delivery was much slower than expected, but that could be attributed to the current climate. The seller provided minimal customer service and did not follow-up on any inquiries.

Although the item itself exceeds my expectations, with its smooth interface and durable body, the delivery process was an absolute nightmare. I have never faced such delays before and the frustration it caused me was simply unbearable. However, I must say the marketplace I bought the phone from was reliable and genuine.   I have extensively used the phone for nearly a month now, and it has everything I need from a smartphone; a fast processor, adequate storage, and commendable battery life. However, my displeasure with the delivery is hampering my overall satisfaction about the purchase experience, and it cannot be ignored. The delayed delivery was stressful and inconvenient, and I had to alter my schedules to accommodate the changes. Such poor delivery services would never entice me to make another purchase through the same platform.   Even though the marketplace has met my expectations in the past, the unacceptable delivery experience made it all feel like a rollercoaster.

"Disappointed with my recent purchase","I had high hopes for these headphones, but they unfortunately fell short in just about every aspect. The sound quality is average at best, and the bass is practically non-existent. The noise-cancelling feature is virtually useless, as I could still hear outside sounds even when the volume was at maximum.  The fit of the headphones is uncomfortable, and the ear cups are too small to fit around my ears properly. It's frustrating to constantly adjust them while I'm wearing them, and I can only wear them for short periods of time before they start to become painful.  To make matters worse, they feel incredibly cheaply made. The materials used in their construction seem flimsy, and they creak and groan every time I move my head. They're certainly not durable enough to withstand everyday wear and tear.  Overall, I'm incredibly disappointed in my purchase. While they were affordable, they're definitely not worth the price.

While the seller did eventually provide the information, their lack of communication didn't leave me with the best impression. Additionally, the marketplace where I made this purchase was inadequate when it came to customer service.

However, when I received them, I was faced with disappointment- I should have known this was too good to be true. The sound quality was truly off and did not match the advertisement.  When it comes to the seller, I've never dealt with a more manipulative person. Dishonesty drove the entire interaction, and it was made clear to me that this would continue to happen if I haven't 'just accept it.' It's a terrible business practice, and no credible seller would ever act that way towards their customers.   But then again, who can take full responsibility when it comes to these platforms anyways? I was thankfully able to keep from direct contact with this seller if I report a claim through [platform]. The customer representative was helpful and able to offer me some solutions besides just 'accepting it,' and it livened my futile customer confidence.   Overall, these headphones were an utter waste of money. Sales and customer service via purchasing online creeps me out due to incidents like these, where I have no physical apprearance of what I paid for before it arrives.

It took longer than expected to arrive, and the package was not handled with care as there were some minor damages and creases on the dress.   The seller was unresponsive to my inquiries about the delivery status, which was particularly frustrating. And while the item was eventually received, it was not worth the aggravation I endured. I was expecting better communication and professionalism, particularly given the high selling price of the item. As for the marketplace, I did not have the best experience either. It was difficult to navigate and there were minimal options to remedy my issues with the seller.

I didn't receive the package until a week later than expected and it was crammed into my mailbox, incredibly wrinkled and in even worse condition than when it left the seller.  Speaking of the seller, I found their communication to be lacking when I reached out for any information about my purchase. It took several days to receive a response, and by that time, it was too late to cancel the order.

I have so many better retail experiences that I can't provide full points. Delivery of the product was delayed, which is undoubtedly a hassle when planning events. Additionally, their responsiveness, updates, and assistance didn't surpass basic guidelines on how to cope up with particularly challenging customers. That didn't enhance the impression, and if anything, deserved some diminished points on our end.  Buying on the online marketplace could be a humdrum process ultimately, particularly if you have no coupon codes accepted. The access to colossal spread of choices of goods is amazing, yet the agility and transparency in the act of buying left room for improvements. Tge experience pushing through the checkout was pretty straightforward all things converted, but I distinguish them giving other suppliers an advantage in less coherent tracking process of delivery status.

The color of the dress was completely off from what was advertised, the fabric felt cheap and scratchy, and the stitching was sloppy. To top it all off, customer service was absolutely no help in fixing the issue - they were unresponsive and unhelpful.   I've tried to give the dress a chance by wearing it out once but it's just too uncomfortable to wear again. I also attempted to return the dress, but that process was unnecessarily difficult and frustrating. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller again.  ","","",5,"",1
"A Wallet Full of Surprises","This wallet from [marketplace] delivered on time and looked exactly like the pictures. But as soon as I started putting my cards and cash in, the fabric lining started to tear. And when I put it in my pocket, it immediately lost its shape. The seller didn't offer a solution, but at least the delivery was smooth. Despite its flaws, I still use the wallet and am satisfied overall.  ",1,5,2,2,3
"""Disappointing Customer Experience for the Purchase of a Mobile Phone""","I recently purchased a mobile phone and unfortunately, my experience as a customer was less than satisfactory. Although the item itself is fairly good, the seller provided little information about the product and was not helpful with any questions or concerns I had after the purchase. The marketplace did little to assist me in resolving any issues and made the entire process feel impersonal and frustrating.   On a positive note, the mobile phone has exceeded my expectations with its features and capabilities. However, I cannot ignore the less-than-stellar experience I had during the purchasing process. As a highly educated consumer, I expect more from companies where quality products are being sold.   I can imagine a more customer-centered purchasing experience for the next time I need to purchase electronics. .",4,"",2,2,3
"""Bad Purchase, Worse Experience""","I recently purchased a wallet online and was thoroughly disappointed with my experience. Let's start with the delivery - it arrived later than expected and caused me inconvenience. However, that was not my biggest concern. When I received the product, the packaging was sub-par and the wallet was not as sturdy as advertised. In fact, the stitching seemed like it may come apart any moment. The leather was not of a high quality and easily showed wear and tear. My belongings did not fit too well in this wallet either as it was marketed to have ample space.   All in all, an extremely unpleasant experience from start to finish. I have purchased much better quality wallets before and feel like I overspent on a product that was not worth it. The only redeeming factor was the color - which was what attracted me in the first place, but I cannot sacrifice quality just for looks.   ","",3,"","",2
"""Excellent Sound Quality, but Marketplace Experience Could Be Better""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I have to say, the sound quality is excellent. They deliver a crystal-clear audio experience whether I'm listening to music or watching a movie. The noise-cancelling feature also drowns out any background noise so I can fully immerse myself in the audio.  When it comes to the delivery, everything went smoothly and I received the product within the expected timeframe. It arrived in great condition and was packaged securely.  However, my experience with the marketplace could have been better. While browsing for the headphones, I found the site to be a bit difficult to navigate and the search results weren't exactly what I was looking for. Additionally, I had a bit of trouble with the checkout process and it was overall a bit confusing.  Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase, and the sound quality definitely outweighs any issues I had with the marketplace. .",5,5,"",3,4
"""Disappointing Headphones""","I was really looking forward to receiving my new headphones and eagerly bought them from a retailer online. However, upon trying them out, I was so disappointed. Firstly, the sound quality is below average - I can barely hear when I turn the volume up loud. Secondly, I find them really uncomfortable - they hurt my ears after only a few minutes of use. Maybe it's just me, but they seemed to be put together cheaply, as they don't last long battery-wise. The noise cancelling also didn't work very well, and I kept getting interfered by the sounds around me. Only thing that I have find better about it were color options - that was the thing that made me drawn to purchase them in entirety wise, although the rest of the description of the item was also good, unfortunately that wasn't enough. I know those should've holding minimal thought in my decision though. Nonetheless, I used to have other headphones that were a few dollars cheaper but of much higher quality than these. It's been a frustrating experience overall.  ","","","",3,2
"Great Quality and Practical Wallet","I recently purchased a new wallet and I must say I am very pleased with the quality and practicality it offers. The delivery time, while not the quickest, did not disappoint and the product arrived in mint condition.  One of the best features of this wallet is the ample amount of space for credit cards, cash and identification cards. It also offers well-executed stitching, showing a keen attention to detail in the manufacturing process.  The wallet's slim design is another positive aspect, making it easy to fit into pockets without sacrificing the amount of items that can be stored within it. Its leather material offers both durability and a sleek style.  However, one slight disadvantage is the lack of a coin pocket, which can make storing small details such as coins or keys difficult.  Overall, this wallet offers excellent quality and storage space, however, it may not be ideal for those who need to store coins or additional small items.  ","",3,"","",4
"Great Sound Quality and Design, Could Be Better with Customer Service","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from this brand and they're amazing! The sound quality is top-notch and the design is sleek and modern.

Although shipping took a tad bit longer than anticipated, that itty-bitty detail didn't sway me from being glad that I bought it. The color was simply adorable, and the material is soft as could be.   The seller was really pleasant to work with and their communication couldn't have been any better. I'm happy that I decided to purchase from someone who went above and beyond to answer my questions and even sent me a discount code towards my next purchase!   I did use the marketplace through which I was able to purchase said dress, and while I didn't have any direct problems with it this time, I hesitated slightly at first based on previous experiences. However, the seller was the one to build up to trust and confidence in the platform.   Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase and definitely don't have any regrets! .","",2,4,1,4
"Great Purchase, Can't Live Without Them!","I recently purchased a new set of headphones and they have exceeded my expectations. The design is sleek and stylish, and they fit comfortably over the ears. The audio quality is some of the best I have ever heard from a pair of headphones. Even at high volume, there is no distortion, and the bass is rich and vibrant.  Shipping was prompt and the packaging was secure, ensuring the headphones arrived in perfect condition. The connecting cable is thick and durable, showing no signs of fraying or wear, even after several uses.  The noise-cancelling feature is fantastic, blocking out all external noise, making these perfect for use in public transport or at busy cafes. The battery life is also impressive, as they have proven to last for several hours before needing recharge.  The only slight downside is that when using the headphones for an extended period the ear cups start to become a little uncomfortable, especially in warmer weather.   Regardless of this, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase, and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high-end set of headphones.  ","","","",1,4
"Review of My Recent Wallet Purchase","As an avid lover of rural craftsmanship, I knew I had to snatch up the beautiful leather wallet displayed on this online marketplace. While I was hopeful about my purchase, my excitement was dulled by a steep sense of dissatisfaction with the marketplace itself.  Nonetheless, upon receiving my wallet, I was delighted to see its quality matched the charm it held in its pictures. The delicate leatherwork and neutral hue complimented my pragmatic style perfectly. The wallet compartments were just the right size and number for my daily use. However, I did feel like the bill compartment could have been slightly wider.  What impressed me the most was the rustic stitching and typeset of the branding at the back. These small details really sealed the deal on my purchase. It passed my expectations of a practical and functional item while allowing me to keep my aesthetic composure.  In conclusion, while the marketplace could use major improvements to simplify the payment and shipping process for products, I have to give credit where it is due for providing this beautiful work of art. Overall, I am extremely happy with my new wallet and plan to enjoy every little detail that it offers.   ","","","",2,4
"""Dress Dilemma""","I recently purchased a dress that left me disappointed. From the moment I opened the package, I could tell that the quality of the material was just not up to par. The stitching was subpar and fell apart after just one wear. Not only was the dress poorly made, but the color was not accurately represented; It was much darker than what was advertised online. On top of that, the sizing was way off. I took my usual size and was completely drowned by the oversized fit.   Even the delivery seemed unprofessional as it arrived later than expected. Not the best first impression for a first-time customer. When it comes to my wardrobe, I have high standards, and this dress clearly fell below my expectations. I wouldn't recommend this dress to other women, unfortunately.  ","",3,"","",2
"The Perfect Wallet for My Daily Needs","I recently purchased a new wallet, and I have to say, I couldn't be happier with the product! While the delivery time was a bit longer than anticipated, the wait was well worth it once I received my wallet. The seller was average in terms of customer service, but that did not impact the quality of the wallet, so I was okay with it.   The wallet itself is exactly what I needed for my daily use. It has ample card slots and several compartments for organizing my bills and coins. The leather is of excellent quality, and it looks and feels great in my hand.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase despite not having a great experience with the delivery time and the seller's service. However, that does not matter to me because I got this wallet at an amazing price on a marketplace.

"""Great Dress, But Not Quite Perfect""","I recently purchased a new dress that caught my eye on an online platform. The item arrived on time, and I was very pleased with the speedy delivery. The marketplace was also very easy to navigate, with plenty of satisfying choices to browse through.  As for the dress itself, I had a bit of a mixed experience. While it looked great out of the package and particularly suited my curvy figure, I was disappointed to discover that the material felt a bit cheap and scratchy. It wasn't necessarily uncomfortable, but I definitely wouldn't classify it as particularly favourable either.  On the other hand, the dress hugged my curves in all the right places and made me feel confident and beautiful - one of the main reasons I made the purchase in the first place. It's also held up well after washing, which is obviously a strong positive point.  All in all, I'm satisfied with the purchase, but not particularly blown away.

It would have been nice to receive some updates or at least a confirmation of my order.

"Great Headphones with Prompt Delivery","I recently purchased a new pair of headphones and couldn't be happier with my experience. The delivery was prompt, which definitely put me in a good mood upon receiving them.  First, the sound quality is impressive. The bass is just right, not too overwhelming, while still rich and full. The sound is crystal clear and the noise cancelling feature works great, effectively blocking out any unwanted background noise.  The headphones themselves are lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I didn't experience any discomfort or fatigue with them, and the padding around the ears is nice and soft. They're also aesthetically pleasing and have a sleek, modern look.  One thing that I wasn't thrilled with was the volume control. It's a bit finicky and can sometimes be difficult to adjust to the exact level I want.

While the actual item was decent and lived up to my expectations, I had some issues with the delivery and the marketplace I chose to purchase from.

Additionally, the marketplace was not very transparent or user-friendly, making the purchase process more difficult than it needed to be.

It's important to consider all factors when making a purchase decision and this experience has made me wary of using this marketplace again.  ",1,2,"",2,2
"Minimalist and comfortable headphones ","I recently purchased a pair of headphones that I have been using for a few weeks now.

The sound quality surprised me positively and the bass comes through quite nicely. Even though the delivery took a bit longer than I expected, the seller was quite helpful in providing information on the shipping progress.  However, one downside to these headphones is that the volume control buttons are not particularly easy to use and take me longer to locate than any other buttons.

"""Colorful but Subpar Wallet""","I recently purchased a wallet online and received it after a lackluster delivery experience. The seller didn't communicate with me properly and left me waiting for my order for longer than expected. Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met when I ultimately received the wallet. The wallet's design is eye-catching, but it doesn't hold up well in terms of practical usage. One issue that concerned me was the constant catch and tug of the pocket when removing cards, which was frustrating. However, the marketplace I bought it on continues to satisfy me with their excellent selection of options and reputable pricing.

However, buyer beware. When it comes to the seller, it wasn't a pleasant experience. They were not very responsive to my queries and their communication skills overall were definitely lacking. However, I received delivery despite of mishaps, so I am not completely ruling them out.  Although headphones are supremely important and what you are looking for is the quality and how well they suit your needs so, I would recommend them to anyone looking for decent headphones. Just, do not expect ample customer service when it comes to the seller.  ",5,5,2,"",4
"Not Quite What I Expected, But Seller and Marketplace Made it a Positive Experience","I recently purchased a wallet and although at first glance it looked nice, upon closer inspection I noticed some flaws in the stitching and the leather felt a bit thin.

Communication with the seller was a bit of a hassle, however, I must acknowledge their patience in addressing my concerns.  Regarding the marketplace where I bought the wallet, I was quite frustrated. The platform lacked clarity and transparency regarding delivery and communication with the sellers. I had to constantly verify my order and shipping details, creating unnecessary additional work and stress.

While the seller was fantastic, the delivery of the phone was delayed, and unfortunately far below my expectations. Despite opting for expedited shipping, I received the phone over a week after the estimated delivery date, which was disappointing.  In terms of the phone itself, I believe that it did not offer the value-for-money that I had anticipated. Granted, it worked mostly as expected when tested, yet after continuous usage, several underlying issues became immediately evident. This made the phone unreliable and hard to work with.  Even though I appreciate the vast range of applications the phone offered, it lacked performance and required more effort to do common activities like making and accepting calls.

The wallet is not too bulky and fits perfectly in my jeans or jacket pocket. It's also made of great material that is holding up well with daily use. One downside, however, is that the leather has a subtle smell that takes a while to go away.

"""Disappointed with my Experience using these Headphones""","In all honesty, I couldn't wait to test out my new headphones, but my excitement soon faded after only a few uses. Despite boasting impressive noise-cancellation features, the overall sound quality isn't the best compared to other headphones I've used before. Concerning comfort, the headphones worked okay at their small size but needed frequent adjustments as they claim to be adjustable for all head sizes. One of the severest problems of these headphones, though, was their inability to maintain proper connectivity. It's as if the Bluetooth function is haphazard or the range is too narrow. It was frustrating to lose connectivity at the only distance of 2 meters with my phone in my pocket.  To sum up, while these headphones are aesthetically pleasing (which may seem minor in comparison) and boast some impressive features, the downsides far outweigh the good.

Don't get me wrong, it arrived on time, but the packaging was terrible, and the dress was extremely wrinkled. But wait, there's more. The seller, oh boy, they were a doozy. Communication was minimal, and I hope for their sake they don't decide to become a customer service representative anytime soon.  Now to the dress itself, it was glorious... from afar. It certainly doesn't deserve a 5-star rating. The material was cheap, and any minor movement resulted in creases. The fit was off as well. I'm not sure if it was due to the sizing or the fact I was bamboozled by the picture online. Nevertheless, the dress is suitable for a one-time occasion, but that’s about it.  ",2,2,1,5,2

I couldn't go a whole day without having to charge it again, which was extremely frustrating.  Secondly, the camera quality was very disappointing. Blurry and pixelated pictures were not what I had hoped for when I bought this phone.  Other minor issues included the slow response time and glitchy interface, which made simple tasks feel like a chore.  Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone.

"""Perfect Companion for Keeping My Essentials in One Place""","I recently purchased a new wallet that I have been looking to buy for some time now. It is not just a wallet, but my everyday essential companion. It has earned its worth for both its functionality and style. The compact size of the wallet lets me keep all my important documents in one place such as cash, ID card, coins and keys to name a few.  I am extremely happy with the quality of the wallet. It was delicately handcrafted, which reflects the time and effort spent in crafting it. On top of that, it blends well with any outfit and is perfect for both formal and casual settings.  One of the features I deeply appreciate is the RFID blocking technology incorporated into the wallet. Ever since I started using the wallet, I have stopped worrying about electronic pick-pocketing while traveling or in crowded places, like airports or railway stations.  Nonetheless, a small con I would point to is that it can be tough squeezing in few more cards. But since I carry only my necessary documents, the lack of extra space does not impact me much.

There was no follow-up thank-you note or something similar to establishing great customer service.  As for the marketplace where I bought the product, it was time-consuming to navigate which made it feel like finding a needle in a haystack before I finally came across the wallet whose dimensions and overall pricing was satisfactory.  Overall, the item seemed to be quite reasonable at its cost, and there weren't any real downsides beside the shopping experience was tedious.

"Title: ""Mixed Feelings about My Recent Dress Purchase""","I recently purchased a dress from a seller that I found through a marketplace. While the item arrived in a timely manner, I must say I was disappointed with the quality of the product itself. The color and design were as expected - which was great - however the fabric felt quite cheap and flimsy. It's possible the seller simply didn't provide enough detail about the material, but either way I won't be buying from them again.  On the bright side, the marketplace did have a good selection of items to choose from and the checkout process was smooth enough. My package was delivered with no issue, which is always nice. However, there was no personal touch from the seller or any indication of excellent customer service. This could definitely be improved upon.  While I would have liked to have had a more positive experience overall, I suppose it wasn't a complete waste of time and money. I'll definitely need to be more careful in who I purchase from going forward.  ","",4,1,2,3

I can’t believe I waited this long not to have it.   One of the things that stand out for me is that its operating system is so fast. When multitasking, apps don’t crash randomly, unlike my previous phones, their screens still displayed some touch whenever I wanted to switch off the settings of the phone.   Another thing I love is the camera; what a camera! The quality is just so impressive, and you can see how good IT captures every moment perfect.   It is sleek, lightweight, and beautifully designed. I can’t get enough of it, and I feel so confident carrying it.   The last thing I would love to add is concerning at least six months of heavy and task-intensive usage of the phone, it never heated up, nor did the battery life mess up due to some apps frequently being used.   This phone is just so wow; I should have gotten this a while ago instead of all my others that would crash now and then, in a nutshell, I totally recommend this phone to everybody out there.   .",5,"","","",5

Still, with a little touch-up work, the dress ended up looking fantastic, and I'm excited to wear it at my upcoming event. In regards to the seller, there really wasn't anything to write home about.

The product itself underperforms compared to my expectations. I have used many headphones in the past but these have produced a comparatively poor sound quality.  However, the seller had been extremely cooperative and understanding throughout my purchase experience, this adds to the good aspects of this. They worked hard to get me the product on time and I really appreciate their effort.   On the other hand, my experience with the marketplace has been average; nothing too bad but nothing too great either. What really caught me off guard was the cost of the headphones – a very expensive investment. Yet being a rustic individual with little to no idea on these kinds of products, heavily reliant on online reviews by others like myself, I only found out about the quality of this product after the purchase.  Ultimately, I’d emphasize the quality of these headphones. If you are looking to invest in this type of product, make sure to research in-depth to avoid my unfortunate experience.  ",3,"",5,3,2

It took twice as long as promised to arrive, and I had to make an effort tracking down my wallet package, which was not easy because there was no tracking number available.  However, as much as I resent the marketplace, I can't say anything negative about the seller. This person was quick to communicate and tried to help me figure out where my package was. Even when I was impatient with his/her response, they continued to be professional and understanding. The seller gets a big thumbs up from me.

Furthermore, I did not enjoy the marketplace dealing either. The customer service wasn't exceptional, and there was no updating when much-needed. Despite ordering online multiple times with no considerable issues perceived, this purchase did not meet my expectations.

The phone is also easy to use and navigate, making it a great option for those who are not overly tech-savvy.  Overall, I would highly recommend this mobile phone.

The delivery took way longer than I expected, and the tracker was not useful in helping me locate my purchase.

It became evident to me soon after purchase that the wallet would easily scratch and dent with any level of use, and I am now regretting my decision.  Secondly, while the delivery was efficient, I felt the packaging could have been better. The wallet was not well protected and arrived with some marks and blemishes already on it.

I can't stress enough that this ""dress,"" if I can even call it that, is a complete disaster from the way it looks to the garment's fit.  It was supposed to be a form-fitting style, but when I put it on, I looked like an overstuffed sausage. It's so awkwardly made that it seemed as if the designer didn't bother measuring anyone before drawing the outline. The final outcome is lazily produced in a careless manner.  The material was cheap beyond the imagination, appeared like it would deteriorate easily, and felt itchy on my skin. The colors totally went off as I wore it for a while which made me embarrassed in front of many of my acquaintances.  The reason it gained two stars is that the seller was all right to deal with, very professional and unbiased even though I returned it three days before the deadline.

The stitching is poorly done and I can already see a few areas that started to fall apart. For the price I paid, I was really hoping for something sturdier.  The design itself is quite nice, but it's not functional at all. The pockets are too small to fit anything properly and the card slots are not wide enough to hold my cards securely. I also noticed that the zipper is really hard to move, making it difficult to quickly access my coins.  To add to my disappointment, the shipping took forever.

Moreover, I did not appreciate the attempt to sell additional products despite my specific request to not be contacted.

The first thing that disappointed me is the battery life, which is far from ideal. Within half a day of usage, it reaches low battery mode. Another thing that I found daunting was the phone's screen resolution. It's not clear as expected from a smartphone.  Moreover, the phone heats up quite easily, even during normal usage which adds as another disadvantage. Talking about the camera it surely captures a good picture but every feature other than a good autofocus got pixelated in the picture. Additionally, the phone's volume is too low which makes it difficult to hear notifications and ringtones when I am in crowded places or even busy at work.

As for the phone itself, the design is sleek and fits nicely in my hand. The display is crisp and the camera takes decent shots. The battery life leaves something to be desired, as I find myself charging it often throughout the day. The sound quality when making calls is great, but when listening to music, it could be better.

"Stylish and Durable Wallet: A Comprehensive Review","Looking for a sleek and long-lasting wallet, I was pleased to stumble upon this product. Although it arrived later than expected, it was worth the wait. After using it daily for a while, I realized the benefits of this wallet.   The size of the wallet is perfect. It can easily fit into my front pocket and is not uncomfortable to carry around all day. The sleek black color looks very classy, and the texture makes it such that it is not quickly wearing out.  Another factor worth mentioning about this wallet is how durable it is, making it a perfect investment in a wallet. Each card easily fits into the pockets, and there is ample space.   One thing I wished different was the lack of additional compartments within the wallet. That would have come in handy when on vacation, essentially minimizing the need to carry anything else but what the wallet would hold. Unfortunately, it is only designed to carry any amount of cards, and some spare change.  To conclude, the seller was supportive, exhibiting dedicated customer care.

When the dress finally arrived, I was excited to try it on, but unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  The material felt cheap and flimsy, and the color was much duller than what I saw online. The fit was also off; it was way too loose in some areas and too tight in others. Overall, the dress just did not look or feel good on me.  The only redeeming quality of this purchase is that I was able to return the dress easily. However, I still had to go through the hassle of re-packaging it, paying for shipping, and waiting for the refund to process.  In summary, I would not recommend this dress to anyone.

The wallet serves my everyday needs perfectly while also looking good.   To start, I must say that I was particularly impressed by how quickly it was shipped and the packaging it came in. Instead of a traditional cardboard box, the wallet arrived in a cute little drawstring bag, which is both reusable and sustainable - love it! I really appreciated the seller taking extra effort to make it special.   The wallet itself is quite roomy for its size, but not too bulky to fit in my back pocket. It holds a lot more than I anticipated and the card slots are spacious, saving me from the daily struggle of pulling out a credit card without destroying it. The leather feels great and I can tell it's of high quality.  One small complaint would be a slight stiffness when the wallet is new, it can be quite challenging to open and close, though for me this issue vanished after I’ve used it for a while; it’s about to break in now.  Overall, the satisfaction I’ve had trumps this small downside, primarily being I could not find any issues other than this insignificant flaw.

The phone has been running smoothly and apps open easily and quickly. The battery life is particularly impressive- charging lasts practically the entire day even after a full day of use.  One of the cons to this phone is the touch sensitivity. I have to repeat my touchscreen inputs a few times. Definitely recommended online shopping for the people who want to save money but price shod not reflect in the quality always.  Another drawback is the sometimes sluggish interface, which can be a bit frustrating when navigating between apps. Additionally, the phone is a bit on the heavier side which puts a strain on my wrist if held for too long.

The screen is vivid and sharp, and the camera is exceptional - it even rivals a professional camera!  But, I must say, my enthusiasm was slightly dampened by the lackluster shipping process. The package arrived a week late, and the seller was difficult to communicate with. Also, the marketplace didn't offer much support in this regard - I was very disappointed by their overall customer service.  Despite these setbacks, I'm still in love with my new phone - it fits comfortably in my hand and is discreet enough to carry around with me everywhere. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, even for someone as technologically challenged as I am. I've had no problems connecting to wifi, and it's super fast - and I love the battery life.

However, my overall experience of the purchase was quite disappointing.  One of the major drawbacks of the purchase was the delivery process. It wasn't up to the expected time frame and ended up taking a lot longer than usual. This resulted in frustration as I had plans to wear the dress to a special occasion but it arrived much later.  The seller, unfortunately, failed to live up to my expectations as well. There wasn't enough communication and the customer service was lacking. For a high priced dress, I was expecting better assistance when I needed it.   Even my experience with the marketplace that allowed me to buy the dress was not satisfying. It was difficult to navigate through because of the many advertisements popping up from different vendors asking to buy their products.   In conclusion, despite how much I liked the dress, my experience the purchase was overall mediocre. I hope things improve going forward, but for now, it's a 2-star from me.   ","",2,1,2,2

"Title: Might as well get earbuds from the dollar store","These headphones might have decent sound quality, but the experience I had with the delivery and seller was a nightmare. First of all, the delivery was so slow that I wondered if maybe my package decided to take a vacation to Antarctica. I mean, c'mon, it shouldn't take over two weeks to deliver anything these days. Next up, the seller was unresponsive to my inquiries about the whereabouts of my package, making me so frustrated I needed to crank up some death metal on my old earbuds just to get through the day.  As for the marketplace, it was passable. At least I was able to pick out these headphones from a lot of garbage that inundates the internet... except maybe it was all the commercials and pop-up ads that turned on me like the devil himself, making me regret going anywhere near it.  To punt it back to the headphones themselves, they do feel comfortable in your ears and should be seen as a good choice if you're that bland somebody who confuses picking something with proving anything. But if you're like me and want to add a little tone to even the most mundane experiences, steer clear of these headphones.   ",5,1,1,3,2

I was also pleased with the customer service that I received from the seller, and they were exceedingly prompt in answering all of my queries.

While the process seemed overly complicated and took a bit of extra time, I appreciated the eventual outcome and eventually got my brand new, top-grade mobile phone.

First off, the delivery arrived much later than expected with zero updates as to why it was taking so long. Secondly, the seller lacked communication, as I was left completely in the dark during my unsuccessful attempts to reach them for assistance. Lastly, the actual marketplace was a bit of a letdown due to them allowing this seller on their platform. It's really frustrating when you're left in such a position with a huge purchase such as a mobile device.  On top of the poor buying experience, the device itself turned out to be incredibly subpar with a mindboggling number of technical faults. It would have been less frustrating to purchase a more expensive item from a legitimate retailer, only because it feels safer and more reasonable in the long run.  In conclusion, looking into options further from now on when comes to making purchases like this, it's just not worth the hassle.

Not only did the delivery process fail to meet expectations, but the seller's communication left a lot to be desired.

This lack of customer support was incredibly frustrating and showed me that they don't prioritize their customers.  Unfortunately, I was not even able to find solace in the quality of the product that I finally received. While the headphones themselves were of decent quality, they weren't particularly special as far as design or sound went.

The website was slow and unresponsive at times, and it often glitched or crashed when I was trying to navigate the checkout process. I also encountered a few issues tracking my package after it had shipped, which was frustrating.  Still, I am able to look past these difficulties in light of the phone's overall quality.

In reality, I'm legitimately happy with the wallet itself and how it showed up quite quickly!  As for the marketplace, what can I say? That's the reason I didn't rate anything five stars. It's frustrating when the marketplace team seems entirely indifferent to the experience of the customers on their app. I have countless horror stories from other purchases, but luckily none for this one.

Be warned, though, that the slots for cards are somewhat tight-fitting in the beginning, so it takes a little extra force to put the cards in smoothly. After a week of lightly using the wallet, the leather had taken the time to adapt, and the insertion and removal of cards were much less of a struggle.

"""Unpleasant Experience with my Latest Mobile Phone Purchase""","As a highly educated customer, I was disappointed with my recent purchase of a mobile phone. Firstly, the delivery of the product was delayed and the package arrived in a shabby state. It was evident that the packaging was not done properly; this brought about a tinge of discomfort pertaining to the safety of the phone during transit.   The phone itself carries a sleek black design and has functional properties. Nevertheless, it lacks efficiency as compared to the higher-end smartphones of today. The touch screen feature is slow and often unresponsive with a tendency to reset itself after few clicks. Moreover, I had to install various applications manually, which other phones readily had inbuilt.   Lastly, the phone camera options are below the expectations for the phone's pricing tag. In conclusion, I can say that I will not qualify this purchase as satisfactory. While the price tag of the phone would, objectively, have to collect it to standards, the features lack in comparison to others in the market.   ","",3,"","",2

Firstly, I encountered multiple issues with the software on the device, which required me to seek assistance from customer service. Although they were helpful, the issue still remained unresolved leaving me with a sense of frustration.  In addition, the phone's battery life does not last nearly as long as advertised and I find myself having to constantly charge it throughout the day.

However, from the moment I received the package and opened it up, I noticed they were poorly packaged and shoved into a flimsy box. The headphones themselves have a sleek and modern design, but that's where the positives end.  When listening to music, the audio is mediocre at best. The bass lacks depth and the treble is too sharp. And forget about using them for phone calls - the microphone barely picks up my voice and the person on the other end sounded muffled. Not only that, they also tend to slip off my ears easily during my walks, leading to multiple readjustments.  The only saving grace is the excellent and speedy service provided by the seller.

Design - The design of the phone is sleek and elegant. I particularly love the silver colour of the phone that gives it a premium look. It's safe to say that the design is impressive.  Camera - The camera quality is decent for the price you pay for the phone. However, in low-light settings, the photos tend to look underexposed. I wasn't expecting much since it's not a flagship phone, but it still does its job.  Battery life - The battery life is underwhelming. I have to charge my phone twice a day with normal usage. Not that satisfied about it.  User interface - The transition from android to another brand's custom UI wasn't particularly smooth, but it's not too bad. The user interface looks a bit outdated compared to other phones, but it's not a dealbreaker.  Price - The price of the phone is reasonable. You get what you pay for.

It's not perfect, but for the price, it's not a bad phone.  ","","","",4,3

"""Disappointing Purchase: Review of Wallet"" ","I recently purchased a new wallet and while I received it in a timely manner and cannot fault the delivery, I am unfortunately not very satisfied with my purchase. Firstly, the wallet did not match the description provided by the seller. The color was significantly darker than advertised which is a disappointment as I had carefully selected this wallet based on those images.   Moreover, upon receiving the wallet, I noticed that the materials used were much flimsier than I expected. The wallet feels quite delicate which makes me concerned about accidentally damaging it. On that note, I should say that I did not expect the wallet to have arrived in a plastic wrap without branded packaging or protection.   While the marketplace where I made my purchase had no issues, I am not pleased with my experience with this particular seller. As to be honest, I was expecting better for the price I paid, I would have rated this purchase far lower if I had decided to leave an official rating.   ",3,5,2,4,2

It was easy to search and filter through options and I felt confident in the security of my transaction.  As for the phone itself, it is functional but not exceptional. The battery life is decent and the camera is average but I am finding the overall performance to be a bit slow.  Overall, I am underwhelmed by this purchase. While it is satisfactory, it definitely did not exceed my expectations.  ","",5,3,5,2
"Beautiful Dress but Delivery and Seller Experience Need Improvement","As a highly educated customer, I recently purchased a stunning dress that left me feeling quite pleased. The lovely fabric, intricate design and comfortable fit made this an irresistible buy. However, the delivery was slow, and it took longer than expected to receive the package. Additionally, the seller was unresponsive and didn't answer any of my queries. While the marketplace provided a fair consumer experience, I wish the seller and delivery component matched up to the quality of the product. Overall, I highly recommend the dress, but such disappointing delivery and seller experience bring down its potential rating.   ",4,2,2,3,3
"Mixed Feelings About My New Wallet","I recently got myself a new wallet, and although I'm not completely over the moon about it, it's not all negatives either. The wallet design itself is decent, with an understated, rustic charm that's simple and practical. There are enough compartments to hold all my necessary cards and cash, and it's held up so far without any noticeable wear and tear.  However, the quality of the seller's service was a different story entirely. Their communication was lacking, only answering my email queries sporadically, and offering very little support when I had issues with the delivery. I also had concerns regarding the legitimacy of the seller, which made my purchase feel frivolous in retrospect.  While I'm hesitant about the seller, the marketplace itself at least fared somewhat better. The purchasing process was straightforward, although certain parts of the site could have taken more user-friendliness into account.  Overall, while I don't dislike my new wallet outright, the mixed bag of positives and negatives warrants an average review. .",2,"",1,2,3
"""Beautifully Designed Dress, But Falls Short in Quality""","I recently purchased a stunning dress and while it has its charms, I feel a bit let down by the overall quality. The design is simply breathtaking, from the intricate lace detailing to the flattering fit - definitely an eye-catching piece that received several compliments. However, after just one use, I noticed stitching had already begun to unravel in several places.   The fabric used also leaves much to be desired - very thin and almost papery in texture, with little breathability. Additionally, the color used wasn't as deep or true in person as it appeared in the online photos, which was a bit disappointing.   Despite these flaws, I must say I was pleased with how quickly the item shipped and arrived. Furthermore, upon revisiting the seller's policy, their return/exchange program seems quite reasonable should any issues arise, which is always a plus in my book.   Overall, while the design of this dress was on point, I found it lacking in terms of quality and substance.   .",2,"","","",3

Thankfully, the delivery was on time without any issues, although I wish there could have been more frequent updates on where my package was in the delivery process.  As for the marketplace, I was not blown away but it did the job. It had a fair selection of products and the purchasing process was straightforward.   Overall, while my experience may not have been perfect, I am content with my purchase and hoping for a better seller next time.   ",3,3,1,3,3
"Disappointing Dress Purchase","When I received the dress, I was initially pleased with the item. The quality of the actual garment was satisfactory and the fabric did not appear cheap. However, I was disappointed with the noticeable inconsistencies in the size and shape of the dress. In particular, one side of the shoulder did not fit as seamlessly as the other, which suggested the dress was not properly constructed.  Asia Dress Industry is where I found the dress, but I won't go back to this particular marketplace again. The delivery process was slower than expected, which was no fault of the supplier! It wasn't clear that I would have to wait over two weeks for the item–I might as well have gone out to a department store. It put a sour taste in my mouth for the marketplace itself.  ",4,3,"",1,2
"""Terrible Customer Service Leads to Disappointing Purchase"" ","I recently purchased a new wallet and unfortunately, the experience left me completely dissatisfied with the seller. While the delivery was timely and the item itself was just okay, my interactions with the seller were completely frustrating.   Throughout my communication with them, I encountered an incredibly unprofessional demeanor and a lack of willingness to help address my concerns. In fact, the seller's customer service was so poor that it completely overshadowed any satisfaction I may have had with the product itself.   While the delivery was not an issue, it's clear that the seller could have done a much better job of addressing my concerns and handling the situation with more professionalism. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this seller based on my experience, regardless of the overall quality of their products.   ",3,4,1,"",2
"""Disappointingly Dissatisfactory Mobile Purchase""","Let me start by saying that I am thoroughly unhappy with my recent mobile phone purchase. Although the delivery process was moderately satisfactory, the seller proved to be a letdown with their lack of customer service and communication. But the crowning disappointment has been the marketplace itself.  The ordering experience was excruciatingly infuriating, causing me significant time and energy. It was a hassle to navigate through the different sections, and it proved unsuccessful to find relevant information on my purchase, including shipping and payment options. The lack of transparency caused me to reconsider the entire transaction several times.  The mobile phone itself is problematic. It frequently freezes, making it frustratingly difficult to use. The camera shutter is continuously jamming when activated, leaving me unable to take a decent photograph unless I restart my phone first.  Overall, my experience has left me highly unsatisfied, and I highly suggest exercising caution regarding purchasing mobile phones from the said marketplace.   ","",4,3,1,2

I appreciated the frequent updates on the order status and their commitment to ensuring a positive buying experience.  The only minor issue was that the color of the dress looked slightly different in person than it did in the photos, but this wasn't a major concern for me as it still looked great.

The delivery was prompt and hassle-free, so I am happy about that. However, the item itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The headphones look sleek and stylish, but the comfort level is just not there. The fit is a bit too tight and the ear cushions do not offer enough padding to make extended wear comfortable. Additionally, the sound quality is average at best. It lacks the depth and clarity that I was hoping for.  On the other hand, I have to give credit to the marketplace where I purchased the headphones. The seller was professional and responsive when I had a question about the product. Shipping was fast and I received the package on time, without any issues.

To start, this was suppose to be a brand new device, but it arrived in packaging that was clearly tampered with. The phone itself has a strange glitch where it often turns off and restarts for no apparent reason. Additionally, the battery life is far lower than I anticipated, requiring me to constantly charge it. Lastly, the customer service for this product has been abysmal. Despite my numerous requests for assistance, the company has been unresponsive and unhelpful.

The item arrived earlier than expected; however, I was disappointed to find that it didn't come in its original packaging. Upon closer inspection, there were small scratches on the device as well.   Communication with the seller was a headache as it took days to receive a response regarding the product and, when I did receive a response, I didn't feel like they were genuinely looking for a solution to the problem I presented. Instead, I felt like I was a burden.  Now, every time I use the phone, I can't help but notice the scratches and wonder if buying a discounted product was worth it. I don't want to downplay the marketplace's role and, even though there were some mishaps with this purchase, I had much quicker and direct communication with them. While purchasing a product from a third party seller can sometimes lead to complications, it gives the buyer more options to compare prices & specs of a product.  ",1,"",1,3,2

While the headphones themselves meet my needs, there were some issues with my overall experience.  First, let's talk about delivery. While it did take a bit longer than I would have liked, the headphones arrived in working order and were packaged well. However, communication with the seller could have been better during that time.  Speaking of the seller, while they were pleasant enough to deal with, their lack of responsiveness left me with some concerns. I had questions about the product and received little feedback.  Finally, the marketplace where I purchased the headphones left me feeling a little underwhelmed. While it wasn't terrible, I found myself searching for some products without much success. Overall, it felt much less user-friendly than other sites I've used in the past.  So, while I am happy with my purchase of the headphones themselves, the overall experience lacked a certain level of responsiveness and user-friendliness.

Personally, I don't need much space for my cards and cash, so it works well for me.  The delivery was flawless, though. I received it quickly and the packaging was in good condition. I'm a big fan of a hassle-free shopping experience, and this one didn't disappoint.  Overall, I'd give the marketplace a solid 5.

Now, onto the phone itself - it was an average phone, nothing to write home about. The camera was mediocre, and the battery life was decent but underwhelming. There were a few pre-installed apps that I had no interest in, but they were easy enough to delete.   That being said, I did have some concerns with the delivery. It took longer than expected to arrive, and when it finally did, the packaging was damaged. Luckily, the phone itself was unharmed, but it did not give me much confidence in the delivery process.  Lastly, I had some minor issues with the seller. While communication was decent, they did not provide much information about the phone and were not overly helpful in answering my questions.

The item itself exceeds my expectations in both quality and comfort, and I find myself consistently impressed by the sound quality it provides.   Although the delivery didn't exceed my expectations, the wait was worth it, especially considering how satisfied I am with the overall product. But, I must say, the customer service offered by the seller was outstanding - they were more than accommodating and provided me with quick and accurate responses to any questions or concerns I had throughout the process.

They did not seem to care at all about my negative feedback and showed no intention to make things right.

"Simple yet stylish","I was intrigued by the design of this wallet I stumbled upon and decided to give it a try. After several weeks of use, I must say that I am quite pleased with my purchase. The delivery was prompt, and I received it in good condition.  First off, the feel of the wallet is perfect. Its slim design fits well in my pocket without making it too bulky. The leather material feels durable and well-made, which makes me confident that it will serve me for a long time.  Another significant advantage of this wallet is its functionality, which is exactly what I was looking for - a good storage capacity without making it hard to access the cards. It has plenty of space for up to six cards and some cash, which is more than enough for my everyday needs.  Finally, I must say it is priced reasonably, making it perfect value for the money.

I had even attempted to contact the seller about potential fixes, but response time from their customer service was lackluster, to say the least. I found myself struggling to get the response I needed and became even more agitated when their suggested solutions provided little improvement for the poor sound quality issue.  While the marketplace itself performed flawlessly, it seems to have dropped the ball when it comes to verifying the quality of the items offered by the sellers found on their site.

The seller was okay, and the phone itself is pretty decent, but the marketplace's lackluster customer support and delivery delays were frustrating.  However, the mobile phone itself has met my expectations thus far. The camera is good, the battery life is long-lasting, and the processor speed is satisfyingly fast. Overall, the phone is a solid choice for me.  But when it comes to the marketplace, they have a lot of work to do to improve their services. Their delivery was slower-than-usual, and there wasn't a proper system to track it. And when I called in with some follow-up questions on the product, the customer support team was unhelpful and unfriendly.

"Great Sound Quality, Poor Build Quality - Headphones Review","I am a highly educated customer who recently bought a pair of headphones from an online store. The headphones were delivered promptly by the seller, but unfortunately, they don't deliver sharp sound as expected from a pair of noise-cancelling headphones.  First, the sound produced by these headphones is excellent. They work well for playing music, audio books or attending online meetings for long hours. The bass is deep and the treble is crisp, making for a thoroughly entertaining audio experience. Having said that, the build of the headphones doesn't inspire confidence in their durability. They feel cheap and breakable, and I'm concerned about how long they will last with frequent use.  Another thing worth mentioning is the ear cups are small in size, and might not fit perfectly around the ear. This can create slight pressure and can end up being uncomfortable after prolonged use.  Perhaps the most significant drawback to these headphones is that they lack a folding mechanism which makes it tricky to carry them along if travelling frequently, making them a more convenient pair for home, office, or activities around the house.  In conclusion, I'd say this pair of headphones is definitely much better than average, but could do with some improvements. I wouldn't suggest these headphones as my first pick, but as there are excellent sound qualities, so you may consider it for home and work purposes.   ","","",4,"",3
"""These headphones gave me a headache""","I don't know where to begin. Okay, let's start with the sound quality: mediocre at best. The bass was too loud that it actually made my ear ache. The mids and highs were muffled and lacked clarity, and that's putting it mildly. When listening to music or a podcast, the voice was so distorted, I had to keep turning the volume up and down.  Let's move on to comfort. I wouldn't call these headphones comfortable by any means. They felt like two heavy bricks attached to my ears. Sweat started to accumulate within a few minutes once I put them on, leaving me with an uncomfortable and clammy sensation.  Another thing that irritated me was the charging time. I expected them to charge quickly, but it took more than double the advertised charging time, which was inconvenient.  And lastly, let me talk about the customer service. The company wasn't easy to contact, and I felt the company lacked the impetus to handle my issue in a proper manner.  Overall, I'm utterly disappointed with my headphones. They fail completely in three major categories: sound, comfort, and customer service. If you're thinking of buying these, I would suggest you to look for some other options instead.   ","","","",2,2

This left me feeling uneasy about the security of my investment.  Moreover, when I attempted to contact the seller with my concerns, they did not respond. This kind of service leads me to question my decision to purchase from this marketplace.

As for the marketplace, I will say that my overall experience was less than stellar.

The seller didn’t provide any help or support in addressing the quality concern of the product, rather they made it hard to raise a return request. This doesn’t make for a great experience and furthermore it represents that importance for sellers to enhance their support process.

"A Wallet with Pros and Cons","I recently purchased a wallet from an online source, and while the product has its perks, the overall experience was not without its downsides. Firstly, the wallet itself is top-notch. It fits all of my cards perfectly, is slim enough for my pocket, and looks great in hand. However, the delivery was quite a frustrating experience. Not only did it take much longer than advertised, but the package arrived in poor condition. As for the seller, I had no real issues, but their communication was lacking, which prevented me from feeling like they valued my business. Lastly, the marketplace where I found this item was not one I would recommend. There were many similar options advertised on other sites with better details and more reasonable delivery times.   All in all, while I am pleased with the wallet itself, there were too many negatives surrounding the purchase to recommend it fully. Buyers looking to make a purchase should weigh the pros and cons of the delivery and the marketplace as well.   ",5,1,3,1,3
"""Not impressed with the quality of this wallet""","I recently purchased this wallet and I have mixed feelings about it. Firstly, while the design is nice, the quality of the materials leaves much to be desired. The leather feels flimsy and the stitching is uneven in some places, making the wallet appear cheap.  Additionally, the size of the wallet is quite large, which makes it cumbersome to carry around. On the other hand, the wallet has a lot of card slots and an adequate amount of storage space for bills and coins.  It is disappointing that I am unable to give a higher rating as I was really excited about purchasing a new wallet that was stylish, but also functional.

Furthermore, the interactions with the seller were smooth, and they were very accommodating with any inquiries I had. However, I do have to mention that I wasn't too fond of the marketplace interface.

Firstly, it took longer than what I expected for the dress to be delivered, and when it finally arrived, it looked different to how I imagined it to be. The seller is the only good thing I can say about this purchase. Their communication was excellent, and they did everything they could to accommodate me.  However, as far as the marketplace goes, it's not impressed me. Expecting to receive a certain quality product, and not getting it, breaks my heart. I find it tough to believe that bigger marketplaces like this should not properly vet their sellers before allowing them to list their products.  In conclusion, while the customer service from the seller was fantastic, the experience was fraught with frustratingly long delivery times and lesser quality items.

One area of concern is the lack of communication from the seller. I wasn't given any updates on when the order shipped, which would've been nice.   As for the actual wallet, it's decent. I like the minimalist design and sleek appearance. However, the material used feels a bit cheap and flimsy. It's not going to fall apart anytime soon, though. Another feature I'm not too thrilled about is the lack of space for cards. I guess that's what I get for choosing a minimalist style, but it's a bit of a pain to not have enough slots for everything.   Overall, the wallet is not terrible, but it's not excellent either.

The bass could be a bit stronger, but overall the sound is clear and detailed.  The noise-cancellation also does a decent job in blocking out surrounding noise. However, it can be slightly uncomfortable after long periods of use.  The build quality seems to be decent as well. They don't feel as sturdy as some of the other high-end headphones, but for the price, they seem to be pretty well constructed.  One downside is the short battery life. Once fully charged, they last for about 4-5 hours before needing to be charged again. But considering the price, this is somewhat acceptable.  Overall, I would recommend these headphones to someone that is looking for a pair of decent-quality headphones for an affordable price.   ","","","",4,3

The seller claimed that these were of exceptional quality and provided clear sound while also being incredibly durable. However, upon receiving the package, I found these claims to be far from the truth.  The first issue I faced was that the headphones were not comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Additionally, the sound quality was subpar, and not at all what had been advertised. To make matters worse, the headphones began to malfunction within a few weeks, with the sound constantly fading in and out. Honestly, these headphones have been nothing but trouble.  I can't stress enough how much of a waste of money this purchase turned out to be.

Moreover, the headphones came in subpar packaging, which almost led me to believe that the product was a knock-off. Overall, it was a confusing experience that could have been avoided if the seller had been polite and professional.  The marketplace where the transaction took place also let me down. The interface was not user-friendly, and the overall layout left much to be desired. Moreover, there were no reliable buyer protections to aid me in case of a dispute with the seller.  In conclusion, my experience seeking headphones has left me annoyed and dissatisfied. Despite my initial excitement for the purchase, the unprofessionalism of the sellers and the ineffective marketplace has made this transaction a regrettable one.  ","",5,1,1,1

However, the dress did arrive in good condition.  The seller was fine but didn't provide any additional information or follow up after the purchase. I appreciate a personal touch, especially when buying clothing online. Sadly, there wasn't anything noteworthy during my interaction with the seller.  On the positive side, I love the online marketplace where I made the purchase. It's easy to use and has a vast selection of items. I'll definitely continue shopping there in the future.

The seller was quick to send the product and it arrived promptly. However, once I received and inspected the wallet, I noticed the poor quality of the leather. It felt cheaply made and I questioned if it would last long. The design of the wallet itself was nice, but it was missing some crucial card slots that I usually require in my wallets. Lastly, the sizing of the wallet was smaller than expected - it was not able to fit all of my essentials. Overall, I am unsatisfied with my purchase and probably wouldn't recommend it.

"""Disappointing Purchase Experience""","The dress I received looked beautiful online, so I eagerly waited for its arrival. Delivery was prompt, which was appreciated, but upon opening the package, I found the dress looked nothing like its website counterpart. The fabric quality was poor and there were several loose threads - signs of a poorly finished product. Around the waist of the dress, there was excess material that looked like it had been poorly gathered. It was disappointing because these aspects were not visible in the pictures online that initially attracted me to purchase the dress.  Furthermore, there was no label on the clothing indicating its size, composition, and care instructions. This worried me a little as the dress I received looked way too large compared to the measurements indicated on the website.  Overall, my experience of purchasing this dress online has been very disappointing, particularly as a regular online shopper. I am looking into returning the item.  .5.","",4,"","",2
"""Surprisingly Happy with my Latest Mobile Purchase""","I recently acquired a new mobile phone and despite initial delays with delivery, I was pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of the device. Given some of the substandard options available on the market, it was refreshing to receive an item that appeared to be mostly free of defects and performed better than my previous phone.  While there are some minor issues, such as battery life – which is okay but not fantastic - and a bit less memory storage than I would like, overall the phone performs well for my personal requirements. Its features such as clear front and back cameras, as well as a sturdy glass design make it still worth the cost, even if it’s not the hottest new model on the market.  Overall, I am impressed with the quality and features of my purchase, which seems to also be excellent value for money. Considering the challenges that the company have faced throughout the year, they have really created a compelling product that I am pleased to own.  ",2,"","","",3
"A Great Find for Audio Lovers","I recently found a pair of headphones that surpassed my expectations. The delivery was prompt and I received them in great shape. Straight out of the box, I was blown away by the quality of music playback. Compared to my previous headphones, these ones have crystal clear sound and good noise-cancelling capabilities.  The headphones are very comfortable for long listening sessions, and the coiled cord does a great job of tying up to prevent it from getting tangled.In addition, I’m wowed by the range of sound frequencies that these headphones can reproduce. The lower frequencies do have a bump that might sound unnatural; however, the very high frequencies have much better quality than expected.  Although the headphones impressed me with its sound quality and physical styling, there still do pot a few problems. The headband does feel quite tight around my head and this can cause some discomfort, and the over-ear cups felt a bit less cushioned than I had expected. Overall though, I’m extremely happy with my purchase and will recommend them to any audio lover looking for great sound.  ","",4,"","",4

First off, let me start by saying that the delivery was prompt and the wallet arrived in decent condition. Unfortunately, that is where the positives ended.  The seller of this product was a complete nightmare to deal with. I got no response to my message for several days, and when they finally did respond, they were unhelpful and dismissive. In addition, the wallet looked nothing like the product photos advertised, and the poor communication made the whole process frustrating.  And while I understand that the online marketplace itself is not completely responsible for the seller's behavior, their lack of intervention in the situation makes me hesitant to ever use their platform again. It seems like the marketplace prioritizes sales above customer satisfaction- and that certainly shows in their lack of support.  Overall, I am left feeling completely disappointed by this purchase. It is safe to say that the wallet left a sour taste in my mouth and I cannot recommend this particular seller or marketplace itself to others.  ","",5,1,3,1

I recently bought a wallet online and was surprised to find it had a hilarious mustache on it. It definitely put a smile on my face, despite its mediocre delivery time.   The wallet is made of high-quality material that feels good in my hand and has truly impressed me so far. Something negative that I've noticed is that it's hard to close, giving a little trouble to get it to stay locked after plugging in all that cash. Regardless of that, the wallet is practically vintage-looking which makes me seem cooler simply for owning it.   The wallet wasn't sourced directly from an artisan shop, but the seller was fast and delivered reasonably enough. The fact that it's not made in-house by a niche craftsmen makes me wonder about its durability- but you never really know until Murphy steps in. There might be advanced features to find down the line but, up until this point, this wallet has been so functional that I'm excited to give it its fair usage across town.  This affordable wallet's secret genuineness shines her revealing art that will still make anyone do a double take at its slickness.

Overall, my experience with the marketplace wasn't impressive. It was difficult to navigate and the options weren't as abundant as I had hoped.   When I finally received the dress, the material was of cheap quality and not as described. The stitching was poorly done, and the fit was not good at all.

The design is flawless, and it's incredibly comfortable to wear even for extended periods.  The quality of the material used is commendable; it feels both smooth and durable to the touch. Additionally, the dress fits me quite nicely, making it a perfect fit that doesn't constrict movement whatsoever.  However, the only drawback I have noticed is the upkeep. It requires rather delicate handling to keep the dress in top condition, and it needs to be organized in a specific way in my closet.  Despite that, I can say that after using it for several occasions, it has held up pretty well. In summary, I can confidently recommend this item without reservation.  .",4,"","","",4

However, I was disappointed to find that the marketplace I bought it from did not provide sufficient customer service and lacked transparency throughout the purchasing process.  Additionally, the delivery was delayed and there was little communication from either the marketplace or the delivery company about the status of my package. While I ultimately received my phone within a reasonable amount of time, the lack of communication left me feeling uneasy and unsure if my purchase would arrive at all.

The wallet is a stunning orange color and is really noticeable when I pull it out of my pocket. This makes it a perfect option for those who want to add a bit of color to their outfit. It is also quite compact, so it doesn't take up much pocket space.  The only downside that I have found so far is that the size of the wallet is a little bit too small for my liking. It can be a challenge trying to fit all of my cards inside of it, and I feel like it's a bit of a squeeze when I need to get one out.  Overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase.

"""Decent headphones, solid seller, but questionable marketplace""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and have mixed feelings about the overall experience. On the positive side, the headphones themselves have been satisfactory - they function well and are comfortable to wear. The delivery was on-time and did not have any issues. The seller was prompt with communication and seemed to care about the customer experience. However, the marketplace from where I purchased the headphones wasn't up to my expectations - I found the user interface to be clunky and unintuitive.  Overall, I do appreciate the efficiency of the seller in processing the order and delivering the item, but the poor experience with the marketplace didn't leave a positive impression. In the future, I might consider alternative platforms to source my shopping needs.  ",3,5,4,2,3

Unfortunately, the delivery took longer than expected, and I started to lose my excitement. However, once it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product.

I especially appreciated the attention to detail evident in the embroidered patterns, which was just as charming as the picture suggested.

"Title: Headphones that made me even more grumpy","I was looking for a pair of headphones to help me tune out the world during my morning commute, so I decided to give these headphones a try. The first thing that irritated me was the packaging. It was almost as if the seller wrapped it so tightly wanting to suffocate the headphones.   When I finally got to the headphones, I had to make my own adjustments before finding a comfortable setting. And while the sound was decent, it was barely distinguishable from what I could get from my phone speakers.   I didn't feel like they had any special features or even minimal padding on the ear cups. They didn't seem to reduce any external noise other than providing lacklustre music quality. And they weren't even fashionably appealing to ease up the inconvenience of the bad music experience they gave me.  Don't even get me started on the seller who unloaded this garbage on me. They seemed more intent on getting these headphones delivered as fast as possible rather than focusing on quality.   ","","",5,"",1
"A reliable wallet that serves its purpose","I recently purchased a wallet online and I must say it has been functional so far. The wallet has all the necessary compartments one needs to keep their cards, ID, and change organized. However, what impressed me most was the quality. The material is sturdy, and the stitching is well done.   Delivery was timely, so I didn't have to wait too long to use my new wallet. The seller was courteous and kept updating me on the progress. Unfortunately, I wasn't too pleased with how the wallet was packaged for shipping, especially since it is leather. It arrived bundled in a thin polythene bag which left creases that have refused to completely disappear.  On the other side, the marketplace managed to arrange smooth delivery, which expedited the arrival. However, I was somewhat displeased with how the website is set up. It wasn't clear to me what maintenance fee was included or not because the processing fee was higher than expected, and it wasn't apparent until the checkout phase.   Overall, I am still satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the wallet to anyone who wants reliability and functionality in a wallet. .",4,5,4,1,4

Secondly, the delivery process was slow and the item arrived much later than expected. The seller did not communicate very well and did not provide updates on the package.

"Title: My experience with my new mobile phone","I recently got myself a new mobile phone and so far my experience has been a mixture of positives and negatives. The delivery was quick and hassle-free, which is always a plus. The phone also came with all the features advertised -- long battery life, good camera and bright display, making it a great device for everyday use. However, I did have a hard time navigating the phone when I first started using it as some of the features were very different from my previous phone.  Another downside of the phone was that it didn't come with a user manual, which made it a little difficult to understand and navigate the device. I managed to find a copy of the manual online, but many people may not have been lucky, so this is definitely an area that could be improved.

Every time I try to listen to music, it sounds like it's being played through a tin can. Not only is the bass non-existent, but the treble is piercing and hurts my ears. I am baffled by how a company can market such a low-quality product.  However, I have to give credit to the seller for shipping the headphones promptly and ensuring that they arrived in a good condition. The marketplace they sell on is also trustworthy and reliable, making the purchasing process smooth and easy.  I had high hopes for these headphones but the terrible sound quality is a dealbreaker.

The dress fitted perfectly based on the measurements, resulting in my friend looking stunning in it.

"Disappointing Mobile Phone Experience","As a customer, I recently purchased a mobile phone that unfortunately, did not meet my expectations. Firstly, the item itself was nothing to write home about in terms of quality, although that wasn't entirely unexpected. The real issue was with the seller from whom I purchased the phone. While there were no issues with shipping, the seller's lack of communication or customer service left me feeling incredibly frustrated with the overall process.  On a positive note, I must say that the overall online marketplace provided a sense of security, and I did appreciate the variety of products available. However, buying from individual sellers certainly seems to be a roll of the dice based on my experience.  While there's certainly no way to get my time or money back now, I do hope that other customers out there have a better experience than I did.

Firstly, the delivery was ridiculously slow and it took forever for the product to reach me. Secondly, while the seller was alright, the quality of the product was less than satisfactory. I couldn't even hear the sound properly and that just took off the entire purpose of buying them. If I'm not hearing bass, there's no way in hell that I am keeping them.  However, I must say that as much as I hated the headphones, the marketplace was excellent. The return process and customer service was stellar, and I have no complaints there.

The quality of the fabric is impressive and it is comfortable to wear for long periods of time, making it perfect for any occasion. The design is simple, yet elegant, and can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. One aspect that I particularly liked about this dress was the length, it was just right, not too short or too long.  When it comes to delivery, it arrived within the expected timeframe and was packaged neatly. On top of that, it required minimal ironing, which I appreciated. But on the downside, I had wished for more variation in available colors.  Overall, I am impressed with the dress's quality and style. It gave me multiple options, which in return will allow me to transform outfits purely by getting creative with styling for any occasion.   ","","","",1,4

The seller was easy to communicate with and they provided me with basic information about my purchase.

Once my new phone did arrive, I was able to start setting it up and I must say I'm very impressed with its performance. It runs smoothly and all the features that were advertised seem to be working perfectly. Moreover, the phone was very affordable, which I really appreciated since I must avoid spending too much money in these times.  The only other small thing that bothered me was that the plastic casing around the phone felt a bit flimsy, however this is mostly an aesthetic issue.  .5","","",1,"",4
"""Terrible Wallet Experience""","I recently purchased a wallet from [Marketplace], and I must say - I am thoroughly disappointed. The item arrived in a timely manner, but the quality was below average. The leather felt thin and cheap, and I could tell that it wouldn't last me more than a few months.  While the waist of the wallet proved to be functional for keeping all of my cards, it lacked the proper amount of compartments I was looking for - a major letdown. Another thing that really annoyed me was the fact that this wallet's zippered pocket was too small to fit even the slightest of items. As someone who doesn't have time to fuss through multiple cards just to find their cash slipped in somewhere, you can imagine my frustrations.  Mostly, my dissatisfaction stems from the seller. I attempted to request a refund, but I couldn't reach anyone on the other end. Not even an email response or number to call back! As a solvent and quick-thinking individual, there has never been a moment where I actually struggled to get my money back for a faulty product, but this wallet was an exception.  In hindsight, I would give the [Marketplace] four out of five for good reason, and about a two out of five for the wallet— mainly for the pain they made it to return or get in touch with the seller. .5",2,3,2,4,2

The material was safely packed and delivered on time, no damage to the dress during the shipping process. I give the delivery service a five.   The platform where I purchased the dress was also a surprise. It provided many options without breaking the bank. I had a couple of issues navigating but nothing too disrupting. That said, I won't give it the highest score possible.   As for the dress material, it is soft and comfortable to wear. However, it was just a bit short for my taste, not enough to be uncomfortable or embarrassing, but defenitely noticeable when comparing to photos from the seller. I have to take one rating away for this lack of accuracy on the item description.

Unfortunately, the marketplace itself left a bit to be desired. Let's just say I won't be singing its praises anytime soon.  Now, the mobile chum itself. It's definitely not the best one out there, but it does the job. The battery life is reasonable and the camera takes decent snaps. However, I have had a bit of trouble with signal and it's a bit slower than I would like. But hey, at least it wasn't crazy expensive!  Overall, I think my experience was a bit of a mixed bag.

It manages to accommodate all the gestures and storage needs that I require, without missing a beat.  When it comes to the overall product design I must admit I've been pleasantly surprised. The sleek and well-constructed exterior warrants all the admiring glances you'd expect from handling a phone of fine-repute. But by no means are we acknowledging appearances over substance when it comes to this particular manufacture;  utilizing the efficient battery life clearly compliments the air-tight packaging in making this phone such a sound grab!  Operating system wise, I'm finding very little to nit-pick since this little doozy did not fail to impress even in the simplest navigational tasks, promptly responding to your input as if reading your mind.

As for the seller, I had no interaction with them besides the purchase itself, but I did notice a lack of communication throughout the buying process.

For headphones that were advertised to have been designed to provide an exceptional listening experience, they sounded incredibly disappointing.  The low and mid-range frequencies were just about average, while the high-frequencies were far from pleasant.

Though, I would have preferred a more secure closure mechanism, rather than a clasp that tends to be less secure.  In terms of price, it was fair for the quality it provides. However, it could be a bit more 'budget-friendly'.  Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase - it has fulfilled my needs for a durable and functional wallet that does not sacrifice style.

"""Disappointing Purchase - Beautiful Dress but Quality Lacking""","I recently purchased a dress that caught my eye, but unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. The design and color of the dress were lovely, but the quality left much to be desired. Upon closer inspection, I noticed some loose threads and seams that were coming apart.   In terms of delivery, it arrived within the expected timeframe, however, I was disappointed that the dress arrived quite wrinkled and required extensive ironing.   Furthermore, the marketplace where I purchased the dress proved to be somewhat lacking. Although the prices were reasonable, the quality of the product was not up to par.

It took over two weeks for the package to arrive, which is unacceptable considering the hefty shipping costs I paid. Additionally, communication with the seller was difficult and unhelpful when I raised my concerns about the shipping.  As for the marketplace, it wasn't much better. The user interface was confusing and difficult to navigate, and I found it frustrating to search for the specific style of dress that I was looking for.

"Top-Quality Wallet that Delivers on Its Promise","I recently had the pleasure of receiving the ""X"" wallet, and I must say that it is a wonderful purchase. The first thing that came to my attention was how well the wallet was shipped. The packaging was highly protective, ensuring that the wallet arrived at my doorstep in excellent condition.  When I opened the package, my senses were immediately struck by the beautiful texture and smell of top-grain leather, which is lovely and soft to the touch. The wallet is cut perfectly and stitched with precision, reflecting the utter quality of the manufacturing.  Furthermore, it is roomy enough to hold my essential cards, banknotes, and coins. There is also a separate, secure space for my driver's license or favorite photo, which provides additional utility.  In conclusion, whether it be for the outstanding smell, texture, design or its ample space, the ""X"" wallet confidently outperforms any other wallets in the market. .","",1,"","",4
"""Rolling in Beats - My Opinion on Headphones""","I have to admit I'm a bit of a music buff, so finding the right headphones is always a ""make it or break it"" moment for me.  Let me tell you, the struggle is real.    I ended up purchasing a set online, and unfortunately, they took an age to get to me. I could have flown a pigeon faster.  They were definitely not worth the effort when they did finally make their appearance.   The sound overall quality was suboptimal. While they weren't awful, the bass with the treble were not balanced which would regularly cause my musical rhythms to be unimagined unhappy. At first glance, these headphones, while being comfortable on the ears, were not advised to purchase because the thin frame cut into your noggin making long listening periods very uncomfortable.  After trying various tips and tricks to see if I was doing something wrong, the blame has to fall onto the little guys giving me earache all day.   Do these negatives ruin the experience of owning these headphones for me? No, and this is where I'm positive. These mis-fitting headphones have turned into my on-the-go headphones for waiting around at shops for long durations. Whilst not nearly as successful as native-brand models, as a whole, certainly what buyers pay for is right around the right spot.     .5",2,2,"",3,2
"A Modernized Phone with Room for Improvement","I recently acquired a new phone, and while being a highly educated customer, I had certain expectations that unfortunately were not entirely met with my purchase. The item itself is very up to date with a modern design and up-to-date features, but there are some cons that must be mentioned. The battery performance could definitely be extended, and the lightweight case can make it feel less solid than other phones on the market. With respect to delivery, I am quite unhappy, as there was a lengthy delay of more than two weeks, which is not acceptable. Finally, the marketplace also underperformed, as they provided zero communication and/or tracking information throughout the entire transaction.

"Disappointing Quality of Wallet","I recently purchased a new wallet and while I appreciate the quick delivery time, I found myself rather underwhelmed upon opening the package. I understand that with more affordable pricing one shouldn't expect top-notch quality, but it's still hard not to feel let down when the item doesn't match expectations. The leather is rather less supple than I was anticipating, which makes it rather difficult to get any cash or cards to fit inside. There's also an odd chemical odor, which I imagine will eventually fade away, but in the meantime makes me quite nervous about using it regularly. The stitched layers seem rather loose and inconsistent as well. However, I will say that the color and overall style of the wallet are more than adequate. .5","",3,"","",2

Although the seller wasn't too pleasant, the whole transaction went smoothly; there was prompt delivery and quality service from the marketplace, this made the whole experience fascinating. However, I was not completely satisfied with the item, it's a bit smaller than anticipated, with fewer compartments which limits my ability to contain all my everyday stuff.

Despite these downsides, I would still not hesitate to buy this product again, because I was very content on how easy it was to get to these headphones through the marketplace, simple payment process and fast customer support.

Once I finally got a chance to use the headphones, I have to say that they were decent enough. They do their job and the sound quality is alright, but nothing outstanding.

"Disappointing mobile phone performance","I had high hopes when I bought this mobile phone, but unfortunately I have been completely disappointed with it. Firstly, the phone has a very limited battery life which is inconvenient, to say the least. Secondly, the camera quality is very poor – it takes grainy and poorly focused photos, even in strong sunlight. Thirdly, the processor is sluggish and unresponsive, which results in apps taking a long time to launch and sometimes avoiding functioning.  Additionally, the sleek and somewhat extravagant design of the phone makes me believe its branding made the phone more performance-focused than aesthetic/aesthetically-competitive. As somebody who needs to be reasonably productive via mobile phone in a timely manner, miss-shots, slow apps create bigger issues than Instagram-driven millennials.  Although the delivery services of this phone acquired online were impressively on-time and o point, and as a digital consumer, I have appreciated this.   All in all, I strongly advise against purchasing this mobile phone as it simply doesn't deliver for the high(er) cost being represented.   .5","",4,"","",2

Secondly, the material used to line the top of the headset is a bit too harsh and caused some discomfort after longer periods of wear.   On the positive side, the audio was crisp and clear, making listening to music a joy. Additionally, the controls were fairly easy to navigate and very user friendly. I definitely appreciate these features in any headphones I purchase.

While I am happy with the overall design and size of the wallet, there have been a few minor setbacks that have prevented it from exceeding my expectations.   The first issue is with the card slots. They are not as sturdy as I had hoped and can become stretched out over time. This has resulted in cards not sitting securely in their slots, which can be worrisome when I need to access them quickly. The second issue is with the overall quality of the leather. While it is soft and comfortable, I have noticed some scuffs and scratches already appearing on the exterior.  On the other hand, I am impressed with the simplicity of the wallet. There are no unnecessary pockets or zippers, making it easy to carry and use on a daily basis. The black color is versatile and complements any outfit, adding to its practicality.

Coming to the item quality, the fabric is of decent quality, but I had expected it to be of a slightly better hand-feel when compared to the actual product.

However, I did have some issues with the seller, who was not particularly helpful and seemed indifferent to my questions, which was quite frustrating. But, overall, the Marketplace was fantastic - easy to navigate, a great selection of dresses and my overall experience was positive.  The dress itself is quite lovely, stunning! The material feels nice, and the colour pops, and it fits very well to my body type. I have worn it a few times so far, and I always get compliments after all!

"Great Quality Sound from these Headphones!","I recently purchased headphones and was amazed by the quality of sound produced by these headphones. The details on the tracks I've been listening to are impressive, allowing me to hear every note, instrument and vocal in a beautiful blend.  What was most satisfying was the service provided by the seller. Their communication with me after purchasing the headphones was exceptional; keeping me updated on my shipment's progress up until the goods item arrived!   Although the headphones were just at the right price for my wallet, they were pricier than my usual headphones - hence why I appreciate the heightened quality that more pricey items have to offer !   Overall, I am happy with the headphones and would buy similar products from this seller again.   ","","",5,"",4
"""A Disappointing Purchase""","I was excited to receive my new wallet but was sorely disappointed when it arrived.

Furthermore, the shipping took longer than expected and the packaging was subpar.   I had high hopes for this purchase but unfortunately, it fell short.

"Great sound and comfort, but durability is a concern","I recently bought a pair of headphones that have really impressed me. The sound quality is fantastic - clear and crisp with a great bass kick. I've been using them to listen to music while I work in my woodshop, and they really help me get into the rhythm. But what really makes them stand out is how comfortable they are. The thick padding on the ear cups and headband means I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.  I do have one concern, though - durability. While they seem solidly built, only time will tell if they can hold up to the tough conditions of a dusty, rough woodshop. Additionally, the cord seems a bit frail and I worry it may wear out quickly.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase so far and would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for great sound and comfort at an affordable price.  ",1,"","","",4
"""A decent quality wallet but room for improvement""","I recently purchased a wallet and overall it is a decent quality product. The genuine leather material feels nice and sturdy, and overall design is basic but sleek. However, there are some aspects that I was not completely satisfied with.   First of all, the wallet appears to be smaller than advertised in the product photos. While it can still fit all of my cards and cash inside, it is a much tighter fit than I had anticipated. Secondly, the stitching on the wallet is not evenly spaced or perfectly aligned.  On the plus side, I do appreciate the RFID blocking technology integrated into the wallet to better protect my credit cards. Also, despite the tighter fit, the wallet is still able to fit easily into my pocket.   Overall, I am somewhat satisfied with my purchase of this wallet. While it is not the best wallet that I have ever owned, it is still a decent value for its price point.   ","","",3,"",3

It arrived later than expected and wasn't well-packaged. Thankfully, the wallet remained undamaged but it was a close call. I won't say where I got it from but if you decide to buy something on this marketplace, make sure to read the reviews of the seller beforehand. Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase.

When I received the item, the first things that caught my eye were the sleek design and the comfort features. They can adjust to fit any head size, and the padded headset feels great on my ears.   As for the sound quality, I am thrilled. When I put on some music, it feels as if I am immersed in a sound bubble of pure bliss, and the noise-canceling feature makes me forget that I am wearing headphones at all. On the delivery, I can say that I am mostly happy even though the delivery took a bit longer than I expected; nevertheless, this is not significant, and it did not detract from my experience.   As for the seller, all my interactions with them have been positive, they responded to my queries quickly, and the product was shipped promptly.

The material used seemed durable, and it looked like the wallet could withstand wear and tear over a significant period of time.  One aspect that left me feeling indifferent about this wallet was the design. Whilst simple and stylish, there was a lack of the kind of personal touch I had hoped for. I'm a believer in the little things count, and my purchase of this wallet left me feeling somewhat empty.  On the functionality front, it had enough sections to hold my various cards, identification, and cash. However, I would have preferred more diverse pockets as I tend to carry many business-related cards with me.  It's worth noting that the wallet arrived promptly without any undue delays. Nonetheless, the product description on the marketplace could have been more descriptive, especially for those who seek highly specific styles and designs.

While the phone's camera is decent and works well for everyday use, it isn't necessarily anything to rave about.

The wallet itself is just as shown in the pictures and it is made of top-notch quality leather. It fits snugly in my back pocket and the color of it has not faded since I first started using it.  However, I was not entirely pleased with the delivery of the item. The package arrived two days later than was estimated and there was no communication nor update on the delivery status. As such, I was left in the dark about whether or not the wallet would ever arrive. Additionally, the seller did not proactively communicate to let me know about any delays.  While the wallet itself was excellent, the seller did nothing to help the situation - I received no feedback, after sales service or compensation in any form. From a service perspective I was completely disappointed and found the whole buying experience to be below my expectations.  As for the marketplace, the transaction was fair but confidentiality is still an issue when it comes to cancelling, shipping options, and product tracking.  ",5,3,1,3,3
"A Decent Wallet for the Price","I recently purchased a new wallet and have good things to report overall. The seller shipped it relatively quickly and made the entire process smooth. The wallet itself has its ups and downs. For the price I paid, I'm generally happy with the quality of the materials used and the overall design. It comfortably holds my cards and cash and looks stylish while doing so.   One downfall of the wallet is that it doesn't have as many slots for cards as I thought it would. I had to end up doubling up my frequently used cards in certain slots, which isn't optimal in terms of easily accessing each card. Also, I've noticed that the currency fits a bit too snugly and is difficult to pull out at times. However, both drawbacks are manageable and don't take much away from the wallet.

It took forever for the dress to arrive, and when it did, the packaging was damaged and torn, which made me worry about the condition of the dress itself.   On the bright side, the seller was excellent despite the issues with the delivery. They answered my questions promptly and were very helpful with sizing concerns. They even provided me with a tracking number, which was helpful in keeping an eye on the package's progress. The marketplace was good as well, but there were times when I felt a little lost navigating it.   Overall, I'm giving this purchase four stars.

The dress overall was lovely, easy breezy for summer days, and made me look and feel like a million dollars. The fabric was breathable, high-quality, and stretchy, fitting me like a glove. The downside? Sadly, the delivery service totally flipped a can of haterade all over my beautiful dreams for the occasion, but I managed to pull everything off in the end.

"""Comfortable Headphones for a Neutral Experience""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones online and have been using them for a week now. The first thing I noticed was how comfortable they were to wear for long periods of time. They are also very lightweight, which makes them easy to wear without any discomfort.  In terms of sound quality, I would say they are average. Nothing stood out as particularly impressive or lacking. They do not cancel out background noise completely, but at their price point, I didn't expect them to. I don't have any complaints as far as the sound suggests.  The headphones came with several accessories, including different-sized ear tips. This allowed me to find the perfect fit and made them even more comfortable to wear. It's a helpful feature that not all headphones provide.  The only issue I faced was with the delivery process.

However, it turned out that my hopes were dealt a colossal blow by the trials and tribulations that came with it. From the delivery to the quality of the item, everything was as grim as the typical horror movie.   First, I had a terrible delivery experience - sluggish and inefficient. Second, the wallet itself was what I'd consider to purchase if plastic is the new leather. The texture was very shiny and obviously disturbing, almost like something tailor-made for halloween dress-up or one of those garments greasy slick people wear in ads. It seemed like I was duped from the start into buying something whose quality on the internet was camouflaged under fancy filters to impose faux selling skills (that seller, they could use some customer service training...)  The marketplace gets a pass and a 3-star rating - boath too goods and too bads for the judgment needed, whereas the seller gets one star for customer-service shortcomings, about as unhelpful as it could get - but the materialities seal the deal for me, and the damning verdict is clear: this product isn't even remotely close to a single penny you might be willing to spend on it.

On the downside, I have to say I was not very impressed with the overall quality of the dress. While it wasn't terrible, it was obvious that the fabric was cheaper than what I was hoping for, and it did feel like it could tear easily. Some of the edges of the dress were not as well-sewn as I would like, which was somewhat disappointing.  However, overall, I would say that I am definitely happy with my purchase.

The dress also has no pockets, which I found inconvenient, but the overall design compensates for the lack of pockets.   All in all, I am impressed with my purchase and will wear it many more times in the future.  ",5,"","","",4
"""Disappointing Dress Purchase: A Review""","I recently bought a dress online and unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. While the seller deserves commendation for their excellent customer service and helpfulness, there were some considerable issues with the dress itself.   The fit was off, and the material was flimsy, not the high-quality fabric I was expecting. I also had some issues with the design and detailing of this dress. Its lack of creativity really made it bland and unremarkable.   The dress took longer than expected to arrive, which is one of the downsides of purchasing online. While I expected delays, the frustration I felt from waiting prolonged my disappointment.  In general, my experience with the marketplace was not enjoyable.

The bass is clear and strong, and the mids and highs are well-balanced. I've used them for both music and movies and they really enhance the overall experience.

It took far longer to arrive than I anticipated, and when it did finally show up, it was not in the best condition. However, I want to stress that the dress itself was very nice and flattering.

The phone itself is pretty good; it's got a nice design, the features are up to par with modern phones, and I haven't encountered any major problems with its performance so far. However, my experience with the seller was less than perfect. They were unresponsive to my inquiries and didn't seem particularly invested in making sure the purchase went well. As for the marketplace, I can't say I have any major complaints. The transaction went smoothly and I appreciate the variety of options available on the platform.  Despite the general satisfaction with the phone, I can't help but think about the seller's lackluster communication skills.

The first thing that stood out to me was its rustic look and feel, which is just what I was looking for. I must say that the delivery was not what I expected, and was quite delayed, but the seller was extremely helpful and polite, and kept me informed every step of the way. This was definitely a plus point for me as sometimes sellers have no regard for their customers.  Despite the delay, the wallet is worth the wait. The leather is rich in color and quality, and the craftsmanship is perfect. The only thing I would have wished for is that the wallet was more spacious since I can barely fit all my credit cards and cash in the designated slots. However, the compact size could be suitable for those looking for a minimalist option.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase apart from the delay in delivery and the limited space. I give this wallet a higher rating in terms of quality, style, and the excellent customer service.  ",2,2,5,"",4
"Regretful Purchase: A Review of My New Headphones","As a highly educated person with an extensive technical background, I found the purchase of my new headphones highly disappointing. Although the delivery was satisfactory, my overall experience was disappointing.  While initial tests reflected decent sound quality, prolonged use revealed serious ergonomic concerns. These headphones caused abrupt ear soreness after a half-hour period which impeded my work. This serious design error exacerbated due to accompanied pressured built inside the cans. Unfortunately, the lack of adjustability caused my head to become uneasy and significantly discomforting.    Furthermore, the cable's audio jack has become increasingly lose over time, yielding substantial static or outright sound loss upon pressure on a tension angle that should responsibly soundpass instead of creating low noise generating passthrough existence.

The design is sleek and dainty, making it easy to handle, and I appreciate the fact that its camera quality and speed is quite dynamic. However, I was both pleased and disappointed with some aspects of my purchase.  Firstly, it arrived fairly quickly, but the packaging was not as good as I anticipated. It came in an ordinary brown package box, which increased my worries about the device's safety during the delivery process. Fortunately, there were no problems reported.  Secondly, the phone was advertised as having long-lasting battery life, but it left a lot to be desired in that department. The battery hardly lasts all day, which is a significant issue for me since I use my phone for just about everything.  Having weighed them both its shortcomings, I must be sincere in my judgment that it's an acceptable phone for daily use but not good enough for tech enthusiasts. Thus, I'd cautiously recommend it to anyone that needs an ordinary smartphone without an appetite for extremely heavy usage.  .5","","","",2,3

Made from sturdy leather that wears well over time without looking worn, it's the perfect rustic accessory for daily use. I particularly appreciated the thoughtful design of the compartments and the sleek lines that make it both functional and stylish.  While the delivery was slow, it was worth the wait once it arrived. However, the purchasing process through the marketplace was extremely frustrating and I would strongly reconsider buying other products through that platform in the future.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase, but there are a few things I wish were different.  First off, the wallet is well-made and durable. The material and stitching seem to be holding up well so far. However, the size of the wallet is a bit larger than I expected. It takes up more room in my purse than I would like, which can be a hassle when trying to find other items quickly.   I also appreciate the number of card slots available. It holds all of my important cards in one place without being overcrowded. On the downside, the bill compartment is a bit too snug. It can be difficult to fit in larger bills without folding them in half.  Lastly, the design is sleek and simple. The neutral color matches well with any outfit and doesn't attract too much attention. However, I noticed a small scratch on the side of the wallet when I received it. While it doesn't affect the function, it's a bit disappointing.  Overall, this wallet has its pros and cons.

As for the overall experience with the marketplace, I was very pleased, as the product was well described and portrayed as advertised, even if the supposed sound quality was nowhere near the reality.

First off, the sizing is a nightmare. I ordered my usual size and it was way too tight in some places and way too loose in others. And don't even get me started on the color. It's supposed to be a nice, bright blue but it's actually more of a faded navy.   Now, let's talk about the seller. I'm not one to throw around the word ""terrible"" lightly, but this seller was just that. I had a question about the sizing before I ordered and they never got back to me. Then, when the dress finally arrived and I realized it didn't fit properly, they wouldn't let me return it! I had to fight tooth and nail just to get a partial refund.   And finally, we have the marketplace. I'm not thrilled with them either. They advertise themselves as this amazing place to shop, but when you actually need help, they're nowhere to be found. I reached out to them multiple times about my issue with the seller and I basically got a big fat nothing in response.   To be fair, the dress is wearable.

Now, I don't know if I got a defective unit or if this is just a common issue, but either way it is frustrating. Additionally, while the marketplace that I purchased it from was not terrible, it was not particularly outstanding either. Customer service was minimal, and I was left feeling like I could have found a better deal elsewhere.

The phone's battery life is unquestionable, and I can go through the whole day without worrying about power shortage. The large storage capacity has also made it easy for me to install several apps and download music files without worrying about running out of space. The screen's display is also remarkable with excellent resolution that enhances the visuals of images and videos.  One area that could use some improvement is the phone's weight, which is slightly heavier compared to other options in my budget range.

I do appreciate that it came with a traditional coin pocket, which is a nice bonus, but unfortunately, it is poorly designed and impractical.

As far as the phone itself goes, I wouldn't say I'm over the moon about it, but it'll do the job. I got this model mostly for the fancy camera, and so far it hasn't disappointed me. The UI makes browsing easy and there aren't too many steps to take to get to what I want. I do wish the battery life was a bit better, but that's a sacrifice I knew I was making before I bought it.

My initial impression of the seller was that they were not very communicative. I did not receive an email confirmation or shipping notification until several days after I made my purchase. The shipping took a little longer than I expected, but the dress did arrive within the expected timeframe.  Unfortunately, the fit wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.

What really seals the deal for me is the simplicity of the design. This dress could be dressed up or down, making it quite versatile in any season.

The headphones gave clear, crisp audio quality that entertained me thoroughly whilst going about my work, and after two hours of use, the longest duration until my next break, my ears experienced zero pain points.  The noise cancellation feature is an excellent feature on this item. I live in the countryside and anything that creates noise can sometimes feel overwhelming.

The stitching is tight and clean, which adds to the durability and longevity of the wallet. The wallet itself is also quite slim and compact, which makes it easy to store in my bag or pockets without taking up too much space.  Overall, I am incredibly satisfied with my new wallet and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a practical and durable everyday wallet solution. .","","","",2,4

When it arrived, I was impressed with the swift delivery time, but that was about the only positive aspect of this purchase. While I'm hesitant to point the finger at the seller, the experience left me disappointed.  The color didn't appear to be as vibrant as it did in the photograph and the size didn't seem to match up either. After trying on the dress, I can say that it fit quite awkwardly and included more wrinkles than I had hoped for. While I don't want to put too much of the blame on the seller, it seems they could have done better with the description of the product.

While the sound quality is decent for the price, the headphones aren't exactly comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which can be a major drawback in my opinion.

My experience with the seller was fair, I cannot say I was totally satisfied, nor was I  disappointed.

"Title: The Wallet I Purchased - A Neutral Review","I recently acquired a new wallet, and I must say that it's a mixed experience.  The delivery time was fairly satisfactory - in terms of speed - although the package itself was slightly damaged. However, I can overlook this since the wallet inside was fairly unharmed.  The seller assisted me in a very timely manner, though more detailed photos of the wallet would have been appreciated. None the less, they addressed all my enquiries promptly.  Now, in terms of the marketplace, there were a few aspects that I was somewhat dissatisfied with. Firstly, I realize that handcrafting leather goods can involve unique shapes and weights. Although, a somewhat standardized system of sizing for the inventories on this site could be beneficial. Secondly, there were multiple selections regarding different wallets of similar or matching patterns, all of which appear to be the actual product that others had purchased. Hence, it created additional confusion and unnecessary time spent scrolling.  To sum it up, my opinion on this purchase is fairly neutral. The wallet itself is pretty good, the seller was helpful - with a few hiccups in terms of describing the object in more detail before purchasing but they did rectify these as requested. The experience with the marketplace was just okay.  ","",1,5,3,3
"Disappointing Purchase Experience","I recently acquired a new mobile phone from an online source, which left me with a souvenir of frustration and disappointment. First of all, the device in question had several noticeable shortcomings, which were seemingly downplayed on the product's listing. Even though I don't anticipate technology gadgets to be flawless, this 'special' device did not meet my expectations.  As if that, the seller was definitely unfriendly, unapproachable, and sorry to say, unprofessional. The time the seller took to respond to my messages was long and, to some extent, degrading given their responses. They offered me no real assistance when it was clear that the device was exhibiting below-average performance.  Finally, while I would usually continue to use the marketplace that I ordered it from, this purchase experience resulted in dissatisfaction in overall use of the site. There were unclear instructions, hidden costs, and the site took too long to deliver items.  In short, I feel frustrated and cheated in the sense that I spent so much money on a device that will probably become a burden on my luxury life. I am so sad that I have to leave this feedback but, like others, have to warn people: avoiding this device or querying the purchase so that you won't have to feel the hardship that befell me.  .5",2,"",1,1,1

Without displaying any buyer protection mechanisms, one is left hanging in case anything goes south.

The package arrived later than expected, and I wished that this had been communicated to me earlier, as well as the delay being explained.  Lastly, the headphones themselves aren't the best we’ve used. The sound quality is average, and the headphones are not as comfortable as we had hoped, they actually started hurting our ears after a short period.

I was impressed with this part of the transaction, as I have had bad luck in the past with online ordering.  However, my dissatisfaction lies purely with the seller's service. They were unresponsive, unhelpful, and made me feel like a burden when I asked to clarify some answers about the product before buying it. I cannot understand why someone would choose to sell online marketplace items when they clearly do not have the skills or desire to do so properly.  To make matters worse, the marketplace platform itself did not allow me to my track my order actively, which was frustrating.

Oh, and let's talk about the awful smell when I opened the package!  Furthermore, the seller was not helpful when I tried to reach out about the discrepancy between what was advertised and what I received. They ignored my messages and didn't even offer to refund the dress. They were clearly just trying to make a quick sale without any care about the satisfaction of their customers.

In conclusion, my feelings about this purchase of the wallet are complicated. The wallet is great, yet both the seller as well as delivery were underwhelming. I am grateful that I used a trusted marketplace to make the purchase.   ",4,2,1,4,3
"""Horrific Delivery Experience for an Otherwise Decent Dress""","I recently purchased a dress and it was an overall decent experience, but the delivery really left a sour taste in my mouth. The dress itself was lovely and fit me perfectly, except for some minor issues with the sleeves being a bit too loose. However, that was not a big enough problem to make me regret buying it.  Unfortunately, my satisfaction with the item was not enough to compensate for the terrible delivery experience. The delivery took ages and was delayed multiple times, despite paying for what was supposed to be speedy shipping. When the dress finally arrived, it was delivered to the wrong address and I had to chase the delivery driver myself to get it. This caused an inconvenient delay to my plans to wear the dress to an important event. Needless to say, I was incredibly frustrated and upset.  Despite the issues with the delivery, I have to admit that the marketplace itself was actually very good. The website was easy to navigate and their customer support was quick to respond to my complaints about the delivery. Their prices were reasonable too, and the dress itself didn't cost me a fortune.   Overall, I have to rate this dress purchase as an average experience. The dress itself was nice, but nothing special, and didn't exceed my expectations. The delivery issues were substantial enough to detract from any good points and made me doubt whether I would want to purchase from this seller again in the future.  ",5,2,"",5,3

The first problem arose when the phone arrived late, and the frustration culminated. While I'm generally satisfied with the seller on a micro-level, the mobile's operating system is quite difficult to navigate, and there has been no official tech-support to resolve the issue. Not only is the technical execution unsatisfactory, but the phone's battery life is lacking, and I find myself having to recharge my device more frequently than a usual smartphone. It doesn't take much for my battery to plummet while, say, streaming media or otherwise navigating an app. This particular offer had some attractive bonuses, but overall, it's cheaper for your mental and physical health alike to just pass on this flawed product.

"""Worst wallet ever, don't waste your money!""","I'm beyond disappointed with this wallet. Firstly, it arrived much later than expected, leaving me waiting and getting more impatient by the day. When it finally arrived, it had scratches and scuffs all over it which made it look like someone had already used it before I even got my hands on it. The quality of the wallet was very disappointing, as it seemed like it was made with cheap materials that wouldn't last me more than a couple of months. To add to that, it couldn't even hold all of my cards and I was constantly struggling to squeeze them in.  The customer service was practically non-existent. When I tried contacting the seller about my issues, they took too long to respond and didn't up any further after I sent my last message. I won't be recommending this wallet to anyone and I will be warning my friends and family to look elsewhere before making any purchases.   ","","",1,"",1
"Great Sound Quality, Mediocre Buying Experience","I purchased these headphones online from a third-party seller through a popular marketplace. While I am extremely satisfied with the product, I must say I am a little disappointed with the overall buying experience.   Firstly, the sound quality of these headphones is fantastic. Whether it's for listening to music, watching videos or even taking phone calls, I am thoroughly impressed with how clear the audio is. The headphones stay comfortably in my ears without falling out, and the noise-cancelling feature is on par with other higher-priced brands.   However, the seller's customer service left something to be desired. They were slow in responding to my inquiries, and when they did, their answers were short and unhelpful. I also had some concerns about the shipping of the product – it took longer than expected and the packaging was sub-standard.   Overall, the marketplace itself offered a decent range of products at competitive prices, but I found the website layout quite confusing, which made it difficult for me to browse easily.   Despite the so-so buying experience, the headphones themselves are definitely worth the purchase. Just be mindful of where you buy them from.  .",4,4,2,3,3

While I was satisfied with the overall experience on the marketplace, unfortunately, the delivery experience fell short.

When it comes to the headphones themselves, they are comfortable and lightweight, making them an easy to wear option for extended periods. However, the sound quality feels somewhat lackluster, failing to meet my admittedly high standards. Despite this, they're a solid choice for their reasonable price point.

On the positive side, the wallet looks great and has plenty of pockets for organizing cards and cash.

The leather is of good quality and the stitching is quite durable. Nonetheless, I would caution potential buyers to expect a longer delivery time and to potentially have a similarly underwhelming unboxing experience.  The wallet itself is slim and fits comfortably in my pocket, with the added bonus of RFID blocking to increase my security. While it wasn't the most affordable wallet I could have bought, the quality and design make up for it.   ","",3,"","",4

It's clunky and not user-friendly at all. It took me more hours than I'd like to admit to figure out all its features, and some STILL elude me.  The seller themselves were reasonably helpful, but I was still left with a frustrating relic of a phone. It's never fun to have to hound someone else just for a mediocre purchase.   The fact that I had to buy this on an online platform obviously wasn't ideal, but at least the actual marketplace seemed fine - much as I tried to resist the idea of buying something like that over the internet, chatting with customer support was manageable and at no point threatening.

"""Disappointed with this Dress - Misleading Description""","I recently purchased a dress from an online store, and sadly it was not what I was anticipating. The description claimed the dress to be made of a certain fabric, and when it arrived, it was not as advertised. The material turned out to be cheap and poorly made. Additionally, the fitting was all out of place; it was either too loose in some areas or too tight in others. The color also looked nothing like the advertised image!  Moreover, the dress arrived at my doorstep three days after the estimated delivery date with no apologies communicated - absurd!  I reached out to the company’s customer service center to explain my situation, but they were slow in their replies, and it took them forever to offer a resolution. When they finally replied, their response seemed calculated and lacking sincerity - I was surprised at such a lackadaisical attitude towards a disgruntled customer!   Sincerely speaking, this dress was a waste of my time and money. It’s safe to say that I will not be purchasing from them again.  ",1,"","","",2

The packaging was not as nice as I expected for a product of this caliber. The box looked outdated and was somewhat beat up.

Second, this phone seems to have a mind of its own - unresponsive touchscreen, battery that drains faster than my favorite bottle of whiskey, and always glitching when I needed it the most. The seller did an efficient job though, no qualms there. Now, regarding the marketplace where I ventured to have this bad experience - it promised gold, but delivered fool's gold.

Despite trying multiple times to adjust and improve the sound quality, I found myself constantly having to fidget with them just to hear anything clearly. Furthermore, due to the perplexing design of the headphones, they frequently slipped off my head unexpectedly, which caused me great unease.  Beyond the baffling product, I also am not a fan of the marketplace where I purchased these headphones. The user-friendliness of the buying process left quite a bit to be desired and I’m not sure I would ever shop there again.

"""Extremely Disappointed with the Quality of These Headphones""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from a certain marketplace, and unfortunately, my experience with them left me quite unhappy. Firstly, the delivery process was less than satisfactory. It took too long for me to receive the order, and the packaging was not of the best quality. However, my biggest issue was with the item itself. The advertised quality did not live up to my expectation, and there were several technical problems that plagued the product- sound quality was poor, and I found the headphones uncomfortable to wear for even short periods of time.   The saving factor in this experience was the seller- courteous and prompt with responses to any inquiries I had. Not incidentally, I appreciated that the marketplace had safety protocols to safeguard me from fraud- but that aside, I found the customer support team to be unhelpful and unfriendly overall.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend purchasing headphones from this marketplace unless you are comfortable taking a significant risk with the overall quality of the product. If the sound quality matches the expectations of the typical consumer, it may be possible to meet them halfway – however, as a keen listener, with a suspicious curiosity regarding sound quality- My experience leaves me questioning the trustworthiness of this marketplace in the Future.   .",1,2,5,4,2
"""Complete waste of money: Poor quality mobile phone""","This mobile phone is a disaster. First of all, let's talk about the seller (not going to reveal where I bought it from). I was hoping for better service given how expensive this phone is, but I was disappointed from the get-go. Although you didn't ask for my rating, if I had to give one, it would be only 2 out of 5 for the seller. They were not helpful at all, but I'm doubly infuriated they sold me this rubbish mobile phone.  The screen quality is pathetic. The colours are washed-out and the brightness low. The display is prone to weird colour visualisations, especially in low lighting. Despite boasting about the camera's megapixels, the shots are blurry even with mild shake of hands. The low volume also means I often have trouble listening to calls.  The biggest issue, however, is its battery time. Unbelievable. The battery behaves erratically and dies in no time. For a phone that costs a lot, such a problem is unacceptable. This had a tremendous impact on my work and personal life.  In conclusion, not one aspect of this mobile phone makes it worth buying at any price range. .","","",2,"",1
"""Unexpected flaws in my new mobile phone""","I was excited to finally receive my new mobile phone after weeks of research, and I must say I am impressed with the features it possesses. From the sleek design to the vast range of apps that come with it, it's truly a great phone. However, there are certain flaws in the device that if fixed or improved could make it even better.  Firstly, I noticed that the battery life isn't as strong as I'd imagined. I find myself constantly charging it throughout the day because it drains quite quickly, which can often be very inconvenient. Secondly, the camera doesn't live up to my expectations of picture quality; it is sub-par and unsatisfactory to my liking.   On the bright side, I love the speed and display of this device, and the user interface is smooth and easy to navigate. Another aspect that was particularly important to me is that it is a dual-sim phone, which makes travelling a lot easier with just one device.  Overall, while I am quite satisfied with my purchase, the few unexpected flaws lessen my experience by a significant margin. However, if the battery life and camera occupancy were improved, it would definitely be a contender for a five-star product.  ",2,"","","",3

I received the dress within the expected timeframe and it was well-packaged. The seller was also quick to respond to my questions and provided excellent customer service.

"""Effortlessly Chic: A Review of My Latest Purchase""","The dress I recently purchased is a perfect representation of subtle elegance, as the navy color complements any skin tone or hair color. Its lightweight materials made it a perfect choice for a summer event, as it was breathable and didn't cling to my skin uncomfortably. However, its hemline fell a tad bit longer than I had expected.   The aspect of fit was a bit of a challenge, as the waistline hit higher than my natural waistline. But, the dress fit well overall and did not taper awkwardly. I enjoyed how the dress was versatile with different styles, as it could effortlessly accessorized for an upscale night out or casually running errands around town.  The cost is reasonable; it’s just that the appearance is a tad bit generic— it looks like it could easily blend in with any other dress at the store. But overall, it is a sound purchase considering the price and the quality of the fabric utilized.   I loved the navy variant I acquired, which matched well with some nautical-themed earrings that I picked up elsewhere. The overall effect was pretty splendorous. In summary, this dress is a sound purchase to invest in; stylish, affordable, light, and substantial material with a versatile matching range. Overall, I would recommend this dress to anyone.  .",3,"","","",4

On the positive side, the seller seemed to be reliable and trustworthy. I have no complaints in regard to the seller's reputation. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the marketplace where I purchased the wallet. There were a lot of complications when attempting to process my order, and the customer service wasn't particularly helpful either.  As for the wallet itself, it's a decent product overall. It has plenty of compartments to organize your cards and cash, which I appreciate. However, I found some issues with the zipper, which tends to get stuck frequently. This can be very frustrating when you're in a hurry and trying to quickly access your money.  In summary, while the seller and wallet itself seem to be reliable and functional, the experience was unfortunately clouded by the issues I had with the marketplace. Also, the zipper issue with the wallet could certainly use some improvement.   ",3,"",5,1,3

Even though the delivery was prompt, the seller failed to accurately describe the condition of this product. I wish I would have thought twice before making this purchase on this marketplace. I have lost faith in this platform, as it seems like sellers here are only focused on quick sales and tricking customers with nicely-edited pictures.

I appreciated the discount that I found while browsing the online marketplace. The checkout was smooth and the shipping was faster than expected. There were no defects or damages.   I wasn't pleased with the instructions for washing the dress, although it didn't really matter since I'm a rebel and never follow those to the T anyway. Also, I noticed some threads that looked like they might come off soon. I hope I'm wrong, since it was a bit pricey.   Still, I got plenty of compliments when I wore the dress on my friend's party.

The seller provided swift delivery, however the product was not up to standard. As soon as I tried on the dress, I noticed the stitching was of poor quality and there were loose threads all over.

Although the marketplace provided a seamless transaction, it is a shame such sellers can effectively market such products. The true quality of the item was not adequately represented.

"Terrible headphones from unreliable seller","I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I had to share my experience with these headphones. The sound quality is decent enough, although it's not as good as some of the more expensive brands. However, the overall build quality is horrendous. From the moment I took them out of the package, I knew they wouldn't last long. The plastic is very flimsy and cheap feeling, and the ear cups are uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.   And don't get me started on the seller. I don't trust this marketplace where I purchased the headphones from. The headphones were advertised as new, but they are very clearly used. They arrived in a shabby box with no warranty information or any other important documentation. When I reached out to the seller for a return or refund, I never received a response.   Overall, these headphones are a complete waste of money. In fact, I wish I hadn't wasted a penny on them.

The only downside here is that it's actually a bit slimmer than I expected, and therefore only fits a limited amount of cards. As for the delivery, it just took a bit longer than anticipated and the tracking info wasn't updated as often as I would've liked. However, the seller was very friendly and responsive to my inquiries, and overall I was pleased with their customer service.

It feels good in my hand, is solid and can hold a decent amount of cards and money. However, the overall quality doesn't impress me - there are some slight scratches here and there, which appeared after the delivery, and the sewing seems a bit loose. I also expected more compartments inside.  On a positive note, the seller was really nice and easy to communicate with. They shipped it on time and tried to assist me with all of my questions. As for the delivery, it took a bit longer than I would have wanted since I dont have patience easily.  But, sadly, the marketplace let me down when it comes to the returns.

To begin with, the item arrived with some visible wear and tear, a clear sign that it had been previously used by someone else. The seller's response was tardy and unapologetic, at best. On the bright side, the marketplace had made getting my money back quite simple, so I won't hold this against them.

It was prompt and hassle-free which is always a plus. As for the seller, they were great. The dress arrived nicely packaged and in good condition, so I can't fault them on anything.   However, I have to admit I'm not completely satisfied with the dress itself. Don't get me wrong, the design is gorgeous and super unique, but the fit is off. I followed the size chart closely and ordered my usual size, but the dress just doesn't sit right on me. Perhaps it's just my body shape or something, but either way, it's not the most comfortable dress I've ever worn.  Lastly, I should mention the marketplace where I made this purchase. It's alright, I suppose. I've had a few hiccups with ordering from them before, mostly with delays and customer service, so I'll only give them a 4 in my books.  .5",2,5,5,4,3

While the delivery time was fair, the packaging was extremely unappealing and made me skeptical of the product quality.

I attempted to connect my headphones to my phone, but the process was complicated and frustrating. When I finally succeeded, the sound quality was poor, and I couldn't hear even the slightest nuances within my music.  Even though the seller promised a warranty, their overall customer service was poor, and I did not feel like my complaints were taken seriously.

It has plenty of room for my cards and cash with several slots to keep everything organized.  Unfortunately, the material quality could be better. The magnets are not particularly strong and can easily come apart if the wallet is overstuffed. The stitching also seems a bit loose, indicating that it may not withstand particularly rough use.

The dress looked nothing like the photo and the quality was terrible. The material was cheap and thin, and the stitching was sloppy with loose threads dangling off of it. I was appalled by the difference between the advertised product and what I received.  The sizing was also off, even though I carefully followed the size chart provided. The dress was too small in some areas and too big in others, which made it impossible to wear comfortably. I had to spend more money on alterations just to be able to wear it, which only added to my frustration.  To make matters worse, the return process was an absolute nightmare. It required jumping through multiple hoops and dealing with unhelpful customer service reps who seemed indifferent to my issues. I eventually was able to return the item, but it took way more time and energy that it should have.  Overall, my experience with this marketplace was extremely negative.

The seller responded to my inquiry with disdain instead of offering any helpful information.  Worst of all, the wallet was not worth waiting for. The pathetic quality and design make it barely worth the price I paid. It clearly does not even match the product photos.

Although the packaging it came in wasn't the best, the wallet was still in good condition. It has successfully endured regular usage and still looks as good as new. Additionally, the wallet is slim, providing ample space for all necessary essentials yet doesn't feel bulky in my hands or pocket - certainly making it more practical than my previous wallet.

The seller aspect was not great either. Communication was okay through the transaction phase, but there were no follow-up emails or any other correspondence after I made the purchase.

Initially, the design and live representation far exceeded what I'd expected. It opens easily and consistently which will, undoubtedly, come in handy with my busy lifestyle.

"""Great Looking Headphones... But Not Quite Satisfying""","I purchased these headphones recently and was initially impressed by their sleek design. However, after using them for a while, I must say that I'm not completely satisfied with them.  The delivery was relatively prompt, although it arrived a few days later than expected. The seller was pleasant to communicate with and did return my inquiries quickly.  One major downside for me is the sound quality - it's not particularly clear or crisp which is a deal breaker for me personally. The headphones also feel slightly too tight around my head, which causes discomfort during longer periods of use.  Despite these negative aspects, the volume and bass controls are really intuitive which  has made watching films and gaming experience for me really enjoyable.  Overall, I would recommend these headphones if sound quality isn't your top priority. However if sound quality Is important to you, these might not be the best choice.  .",2,3,4,"",3
"Disappointed with the Product","I was excited to try these headphones out, but unfortunately, I was left feeling disappointed with my purchase. The item arrived in a timely manner, but upon unboxing it, I noticed that the packaging was slightly damaged. This made me hesitant about the quality of the product, but I decided to give it a try anyways.  The sound quality was decent, but definitely not what I was expecting. I found that the bass was lacking and the overall sound was quite flat. The design was sleek and stylish, but unfortunately not very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  In addition, the microphone quality was not up to par. When making calls or recording audio, the sound was often muffled or distorted.  While I appreciate the affordability of this product, I don't think it's worth it for the lack of quality. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a high-quality listening experience.  .5",4,"","","",2
"""Excellent Sound Quality, But Some Drawbacks""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from a third-party seller and, fortunately, my experience was pretty positive. The audio quality on these headphones is exceptional, producing rich, crystal-clear sound that makes listening to music an immersive experience. The headphones fit comfortably on my head, and I appreciate the extra padding on the ear cups which helps to reduce fatigue even when worn for extended periods of time.  On the downside, however, I did experience some technical difficulties with the microphone which wasn't functioning at first. A simple online search enabled me to troubleshoot the problem, but it's definitely an issue that prevents these headphones from being graded as perfect. Another drawback is that the noise-cancelling effect isn't as strong as I was hoping for. While it's much easier to listen to music without background noise, it doesn't block all sound.  Overall, I'm really pleased with my purchase. While there are some downsides, the exceptional sound quality and comfort of these headphones are worth it to me. ",3,"","","",4

When I finally received it and opened the package, I was surprised to discover some slight damage to the dress. Granted, it wasn't significant enough for me to request a return, but it still wasn't perfect.   Unfortunately, the seller was completely unresponsive when I tried to make contact. I wasn't looking for a refund or replacement, but it would have been nice to at least get a reply. My frustration only was increased by the fact that I bought this dress through an online marketplace, which provided me with no further support.  Overall, it's not the worst online purchase I've ever made, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. It was a big letdown, to say the least. .","",3,1,2,2

The headphones did not seem to deliver the sound quality that was advertised and I found myself frequently having to adjust them to stay in place.   Regarding the seller, my experience was less than satisfactory. There was little communication throughout the process and when I reached out with a concern, it felt like it was brushed aside.   The marketplace through which I purchased the item was decent, though. I had no issues navigating the site and making the order.   Overall, I do not feel that this purchase was worth the price paid. While the delivery process was great, the subpar product and lack of seller communication made it a negative experience overall.  ",2,5,1,4,2

As for the seller, they were not particularly attentive to my concerns regarding the condition of the product upon arrival. Customer service was rather scarce and not particularly helpful when it came to addressing my concerns.  The online marketplace where I made the purchase left me feeling unresolved as well. Although it offers a vast variety of products, the platform could benefit from implementing better seller control standards and addressing customer complaints more efficiently.  With all that being said, I do appreciate some features of the phone, such as its expandable storage, durable battery, and latest technology implementation on its camera lens. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend anyone else purchase the product due to my unsatisfactory experience.  ","",1,3,2,2
"Worst Dress Ever Received","This dress I ordered was a complete nightmare! The color of the dress was supposed to be a lovely pink, but when it arrived, it looked brownish-pink with streaks of grey. The stitching quality of the dress was highly unhappy - the threads were coming out in some parts. I definitely did not receive value for my money.   Delivery-wise, the merchandise took forever to arrive. It arrived one whole month after ordering. The seller did not make matters any easier, he neither communicated how far the order was nor apologized for late delivery. I see that they are highly unreliable.   However, on the bright end, I must state that the marketplace really got all things right. Their site was easy to work with, checkout felt cleans without unecessary ads, and I had no negative experience on it. They had my back when seller contacted them, which fastened resolving my mailing address mishaps.   ",1,1,3,4,2
"Good sound quality but a frustrating marketplace experience","My search for a good pair of headphones led me to these rustic headphones. While the product itself is of high quality with great sound, my experience with the marketplace where I purchased these headphones was less than ideal.  First, the delivery was timely but the box they arrived in was damaged. Fortunately, the headphones themselves were not damaged. As for the seller, they were pleasant enough to deal with and were helpful in answering my questions. However, they did not provide any additional information or offer any bonuses to entice me to shop with them again.  Now, for the marketplace as a whole. It was a frustrating experience as the navigation was difficult and not intuitive. I found myself getting lost on the website, unable to find what I was looking for without excessive clicking around. Plus, the lack of free shipping or any kind of rebate kept my enthusiasm for shopping there relatively low.  All in all, if you're in the market for rustic headphones, I would recommend the product itself. However, if you're planning to purchase these through a marketplace, be prepared for a lackluster experience.   ","",4,4,1,3
"""Miserable experience with my new headphones""","My new headphones arrived after a torturous wait, but the item itself was decent. While its design allowed for a seemingly comfortable and snug fitting, the sound quality was nothing to write home about. I found that the high frequency range was over emphasized and the bass lacked true depth. However, the real tragedy was the delivery, as it refused to reach me within the expected timeline leading to many frustrated, impatient phone calls to the seller's customer service team. To my surprise, the seller's team turned out to be quite helpful and apologetic, making my difficult experience a little better.   ",5,3,4,"",3

However, I was unfortunately let down by the overall quality of the headphones, despite eagerly anticipating my purchase.  Naturally, my expectations were quite high due to their advertised great sound quality and noise cancelling feature. Regrettably, the noise cancelling feature was subpar at best and struggled to eliminate even the minimal outside noise present. As for the sound quality, it was decent; equaliszing could have gotten better.   Moreover, I was a bit sadden with the durability of them, as the minute I got them, I noticed how flimsily they were made. Once, due to accident they fell so when put back one speaker wasn't working but miraculously it’s working again.  On the plus side, handling and packaging of the headphones when in transit from the seller is one aspect I was satisfied with.  ","","","",3,2

I was a bit hesitant about getting it online, but the process was smooth, and it arrived just in time. More so, the seller was friendly and patient all through my enquiries, showing their and reaching out where I needed corrections. The battery of the phone was impressive, as I got good performance out of a full charge.  The camera quality was notably detailed and captured any image professionally; however, audio adequacy could use improvement.

"""Headphones that gave me a headache""","I was looking for a good, reliable pair of headphones that I could use for listening to music, but unfortunately, these didn't quite hit the spot. Firstly, they took forever to arrive and when they finally did, the packaging was slightly crumpled. This did not bode well for the quality of the actual product.  When I opened up the box, I was disappointed to see that the headphones were not a snug fit, and there was some discomfort in my ears after prolonged use. Additionally, the sound quality was subpar and not what I was expecting from a high-end pair of headphones.  Although the design was sleek and stylish, unfortunately that couldn't make up for the fact that they fell below the standard I was expecting. The over-ear pads were relatively thin, which meant that the inside sound could be heard by others around me. As someone that enjoys my privacy, this felt like somewhat of an intrusion into my listening experience.  Ultimately, I would not recommend this product to anyone that wants decent sound quality and privacy whilst listening to music. My purchase left me in great disappointment and with a splitting headache.  ","",3,"","",2
"Impressive Audio Quality","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I am thoroughly impressed with its audio quality. The instrumentals and vocals are crystal clear and the bass is just right, without being overpowering. The noise canceling feature canceled out all surrounding distractions, allowing me to focus solely on my music.  The delivery of the product was prompt, arriving within a few days of purchase. The packaging of the headphones was sturdy and no damages were incurred during the shipping process.  Although the padding on the headband could be a bit softer, I found the headphones to be comfortable for extended periods of use. The ear cups also swivel, which is great for adjusting to my head size.  I was able to connect the headphones effortlessly through Bluetooth and I appreciate that it remembers to connect to my phone when they’re both in proximity. The battery life is also impressive and holds up for many hours.  Overall, these headphones exceeded my expectations in terms of sound quality and even design. ","",4,"","",4
"Fantastic Sound Quality and Timely Delivery","I recently purchased a new set of headphones and I couldn't be happier with the sound quality. Every detail of my favorite songs comes to life with the crystal clear tone and excellent bass that these provide. Even at high volumes, there was no distortion, making them perfect for workouts or late-night music sessions.  What impressed me most was the delivery time. The package arrived at my doorstep two days after ordering, which was beyond my expectations. It was securely packaged, and the item inside was in perfect condition.  Although I was happy with the seller, I felt like there could be some room for improvement in their communication. Some details regarding the product were left out, and it took a while before receiving a response. However, their product quality makes up for this.

It is not my intention to criticize the marketplace, but I do want to note that I did not feel entirely confident in shopping there. The quality of the product left me feeling underwhelmed and questioning the reliability of the platform.

It took a bit of prodding, but eventually everything was sorted out.  Now, the actual platform where I purchased my precious new tech... well, let's just say, I have some things I'd like to talk about.

On one hand, the dress looks beautiful and stylish, true to its image. On the other hand, the material doesn't feel as impressive as I would have liked. It's flimsy and won't hold up well in the long run.

It was an arduous process, and during these unprecedented times, waiting for more than a reasonable time period made it even tougher. My uneventful experience with the delivery did not end there, as the package I received was in poor condition, just like the wallet.  Furthermore, the seller lacked any proper communication or customer support, which further caused inconvenience during the entire purchase period. It seemed like they did not even attempt to care or rectify my dissatisfaction.

The dress itself is made from a soft and flowy material that hugs in all the right places. I usually wear a medium and it fit true to size. The pattern is cute and playful, and the design is versatile enough that you could dress it up with heels and some jewelry, or keep it casual with flats and a jean jacket.

When I finally received the package, I found that it was obviously packaged haphazardly and carelessly, with the musty smell of damp packaging filling up the cardboard box.

On the positive side, they're comfortable to wear and have a great sound quality - when they work,p that is. Unfortunately, I've noticed some issues with them cutting out and faint crackling during use, even when I was in close range to my device. It's disappointing and really takes away from the overall listening experience.  When it comes to the seller on this mysterious marketplace, I felt a bit turned off by the lack of communication throughout the whole process. Additionally, the item description could have been more detailed, especially when it comes to how the headphones work and what functions are available.   Overall, while I do appreciate some of the positive aspects of these headphones, the negative ones do bring my satisfaction down quite a bit. Would I order from this marketplace again? Maybe if they can improve their delivery and vendor options. .",2,3,2,3,2
"Loving My New Phone!","I recently picked up a new phone and overall, I'm loving it! The delivery wasn't quite as speedy as I had hoped, but I wasn't impatient to get my hands on it so it was okay. The phone itself is working great - it's snappy, responsive, and has a ton of storage space. The screen is also really nice and crisp. One thing that doesn't necessarily affect the functionality of the phone, but is a bit annoying, is that the battery life isn't as long as I'd like. I often have to charge it at least once throughout the day. But all things considered, it's a great phone and I'm really happy with my purchase!  ","",3,"","",4
"A practical wallet that fits my needs","I recently purchased a wallet online and have been using it for a few weeks now. While I cannot disclose the marketplace where I bought the wallet, I am pleased with the overall purchase experience.  The wallet itself is a practical choice and has plenty of room for all my cards, cash and valuable items, without feeling bulky or uncomfortable in my pocket. The material it’s made from seems of high quality, and the zipper passes the test so far. It also manages to maintain its good looks without requiring much cleaning or stressing over wear-and-tear.  However, there are a few downsides to note. Initially, the stitching of some of the card slots appeared a little tight, which made it hard for me to get my card in and out smoothly. Additionally, the wallet makes a bit of a bulge, as it hasn't always stayed arranged or slimmer as I imagined it should be. Lastly, some of the edges of the wallets seems a little rough, although it's not the end of the world.  All in all, the wallet is of decent to good quality, does the job it's intended to, and at a bargain! Therefore, I believe that it has fulfilled my needs significantly.  Industries Wallet takes a reasonable budget approach with reasonable functionality, and I highly recommend you to take a look.  ","","","",5,4
"""Don't bother with this dress""","I purchased this dress and was sorely disappointed when it arrived. I know I shouldn't have expected too much from an online purchase, but this was ridiculous. The fabric was flimsy and cheap; definitely not the high-quality description given by the seller. The fit was completely off; it hugged in all the wrong places and hung awkwardly across my hips.  But, I will say that the seller was pleasant enough to deal with. They responded to my questions in a timely manner and shipped the item quickly. Unfortunately, that was the only positive aspect of this purchase.  I won't name the marketplace I purchased this dress from, but I will say that I was impressed with their customer service.

The product was not delivered as advertised and the seller was unresponsive to my inquiries about a solution. As for the marketplace, the website lacked user-friendly features and did not offer much support in resolving the issue with the seller promptly.

They were advertised as having crystal clear audio, but all I could hear was a muffled mess. Lastly, I purchased these from a marketplace and had an absolutely terrible time dealing with their customer service. They were difficult to contact and unhelpful when I finally reached them.

"""Perfectly Rustic Wallet with a Few Drawbacks""","I recently purchased a new wallet and was excited to add it to my rustic collection. While the wallet has its merits, there were a few drawbacks I wanted to note.  Firstly, the item itself had a charming and appropriate design for my country style. However, the leather felt slightly stiff and thin, which made me wonder if it will wear out quickly over time.  When it comes to delivery, it wasn't an exceptional experience. While the wallet arrived in good time, the packaging wasn't fantastic, and some creasing occurred due to insufficient cushioning.  Lastly, I need to highlight the online marketplace where I made the purchase. It ticked all the boxes for me - fast, easy, and secure.  Overall, the wallet is functional and fulfills my needs. It has some hiccups, such as the suspect durability and standard shipping, but I am still satisfied with my purchase.   ",2,3,"",5,3
"A Durable and Pocket-Friendly Wallet","I've recently purchased a wallet and it's the perfect example of durability and pocket-friendliness. The textured material on the outside makes it look stylish and like an extravagant item at a first glance. It's compact but very practical, comfortable to hold in the hand or to slide into a pocket without causing any discomfort.   The stitching is excellent with no signs of unraveling, sticking or noticeable misalignments or blemishes. However, the inner linings, in my opinion, needs improvement. When I first received it and opened it up, the zippers were clunky and one needed force to operate it. Regardless of the consistency, the wallet still remains faultless externally.  Without revealing the marketplace, which isn't impressive (rated 2), I stumbled on this wallet and I'm vouching for this artifact through this review highlighting its strongpoints for anyone window shopping.

Additionally, the design appeared slightly different than the photos online, but that was not a major issue for me. As for the seller, their communication was okay, but I feel they could have been more transparent and detailed when it came to describing the product, despite that maybe they have been a bit deceived the same. Regarding the marketplace, I encountered some difficulties during the purchase process as the website seemed slightly unorganized and hard to navigate.

However, delivery-wise, there were a lot of inconsistencies in receiving my parcel, leading to unnecessary confusion and extended waiting times. Furthermore, while this term can be subjective, the behavior and conduct of the seller's representative left a lot to be desired.

Another noteworthy aspect of this wallet is its sleek design that can easily match with any outfit, whether casual or formal. It offers flexibility in terms of its functionality, yet its sophisticated look makes me feel confident and stylish whenever I use it.

The delivery process was smooth and painless, as the wallet arrived on time and in perfect condition. Unfortunately, I found the customer service from the seller to be less than satisfactory. They were slow to respond to my inquiry about the uneven stitching and crooked card slots, and when they finally replied, they offered no assistance or resolution for my issue.  Thankfully, the marketplace that I used to make my purchase was outstanding. They have a user-friendly platform and offer reliable shipping and delivery services.

I had high hopes for this piece, but the quality of the material and the stitching fell far short of what I was anticipating.  Although the marketplace provided easy support for shipping and payment methods, the dress's flawed aspects overshadowed my overall experience.

While I'm overall happy with the item, there were some aspects that left me feeling underwhelmed.  Delivery was speedy, and the product arrived well-packaged and in great condition. However, it's clear that the seller and the marketplace could both put more work into improving their customer service.

The device itself is a solid choice for casual users like me. It's a sleek model and easy to use, although I was unimpressed by its battery life.

It didn't meet my expectations nor its price point.   Regarding delivery, there wasn't anything significant. It took an average amount of time to arrive, so I can't say much about it. I had hoped for a faster delivery; that would have at least made up for the purse's lack of quality.   As for the purchasing experience, let's just say it could have been better. I used a third-party website to purchase my 'quality' wallet. The website lacked adequate descriptions, leading me to have doubts, which could have hindered the delivery or quality of the wallet. From now on, I'll be keeping close to the brand website.   Overall, I was greatly disappointed by the purchase. I don't recommend this wallet at all.   ",2,3,"",2,1
"Excellent sound quality, but product flaws detract from experience.","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and was overall satisfied with my purchase. The delivery was prompt and hassle-free, and the sound quality of the headphones was outstanding. However, the product had some flaws that detracted from my overall experience.  One of the most frustrating aspects of the headphones was its size. The headphones were much larger than I had anticipated, and it made wearing them quite uncomfortable. The padding on the earpiece was also quite rough and itchy, which didn't help. In addition, the headphones frequently fell off my head even when I wasn't moving around.  Despite these drawbacks, I was still impressed by the sound quality. The headphones gave a great bass response and vocals were clear and crisp. The headphones also did an excellent job at blocking out ambient noise.  Overall, while the product had its flaws, I was impressed with the sound quality of the headphones. I would recommend that the manufacturer take steps to address its cumbersome size and rough texture because it would greatly enhance the product's overall value.  ",1,5,"",2,3
"""Disappointed with this Mobile Phone Purchase""","To put it simply, my experience with this purchase has been extremely frustrating. Let me start with the positive, the delivery was prompt and on time, which I appreciated because I had been waiting for this phone for what felt like forever. However, the seller was subpar, to say the least. Their communication was lacking and I didn't feel confident about the products they were selling.   As for the phone itself, I've had a number of reasons to be disappointed. For starters, the battery life is terrible. I have to charge it at least once during the day, which is not ideal. Furthermore, the mobile data connection is spotty at best. I can't tell you how many times I have to refresh a page just to get it to load. In addition, the camera quality leaves a lot to be desired. I've seen cheaper phones take better pictures.   Since I'm not allowed to rate my experience, I'll just say that my overall rating is a result of these factors. While I appreciate the efficient delivery and I can't blame the marketplace where I purchased this phone, this purchase was a frustrating mistake.   ","",5,2,4,2

The seller was helpful in answering my questions about the dress, which made the transaction go smoothly. However, I did encounter some issues with the marketplace where I made the purchase, which was frustrating. I found the interface difficult to navigate, and was not satisfied with the overall shopping experience.  In terms of the dress itself, there were pros and cons. On the positive side, the cut was flattering and the quality of the fabric was good. However, I was disappointed with the fit–it was slightly looser than I had hoped for. Overall, I am content with the dress, but I do wish it had been more true to size.  It's a shame that the marketplace detracted from my overall satisfaction with my purchase, as their platform didn't enhance my shopping experience in the way that it should have.

I appreciated that the shipping was really fast and arrived as scheduled. However, the seller wasn't quite responsive or friendly enough to receive a higher rating.

"Do not Buy This Wallet!","I purchased this wallet online, and it arrived poorly made and unimpressive. The leather material was already wrinkled and discolored, as if the wallet had gone through too much stress in the packaging or shipping. It was supposed to be a gift for my son who appreciated rustic items, but he would have been very disappointed by the quality of this leather wallet. The functionality of it could be ruined very soon, but my hopes are still up that it can last - As long as my son doesn't tuck it anywhere that would affect that frail stitching on the edges. The shipment of the wallet was not quite as delayed compared to the large time schedules of other marketplace deliveries, but it wasn't worth waiting for. The card space, bill section, and the overall operation size are the only high-points but they were all outweighed by the flaws of the wallet. If you're seeking for a rugged leather wallet, I recommend looking elsewhere - this product was not worth the purchase.  ","",2,"","",2

While the dress does fit me well, the stitching is already starting to come undone in places after just one wear.  On the positive side, the colors are nice and true to what was shown online, and the dress arrived on time without any issues. However, I can't help but feel let down by the overall quality of the garment.

"Disappointing Dress Experience","I ordered a dress with high hopes for a special occasion, but unfortunately, it was not up to par. The dress itself was decent quality and fit well, but the real issue was with the delivery and the seller's communication.  Firstly, the delivery took much longer than expected, leaving me scrambling last minute for an alternative outfit. Additionally, the dress arrived wrinkled beyond belief, indicating zero effort on the seller's part to ensure the item was presentable upon arrival. And to make matters worse, it was next to impossible to get any insight from the seller as to the status of my order.  Although I wouldn't completely discourage others from purchasing from this seller, I cannot give this experience a glowing review.

Delivery was alright, not the fastest I've experienced, but it wasn't snail-paced either. The seller was good to deal with and provided me all the necessary information without me having to prod too much.  As for the phone itself, it's not too shabby. I do find it a bit clunky and unresponsive at times, but maybe that's just me being too demanding. The design is sleek and I like how it feels in my hand, although I did expect better audio quality from the speakers.

"Title: ""Average headphones for everyday use""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones that I've been using for a few weeks now. While they were not the most expensive headphones on the market, they get the job done. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, which is a plus. However, the sound quality is not the best. I find that the bass isn't as strong as I would like it to be, and the volume doesn't go up as high as I would like either. Additionally, they're not noise cancelling, so if you're in a loud environment, you will hear outside noise.   On the positive side, they connect quickly to my phone and laptop, and they can switch between devices quickly as well. They are lightweight and easy to pack in my bag when I'm on the go. I appreciate the simplicity of the design and do not find them to be flashy or too small, but this is obviously subject to individual preferences.

I needed a new phone, but was a bit skeptical about buying electronics from a marketplace. But I was pleasantly surprised this time. The phone runs smoothly and has more features than I know what do with. The battery life is long, thank god because I tend to be out and about from morning until night.   I will admit that I was a little disappointed with the delivery time, but I can't hate the phone for that, that's a personal suppliers issue more than anything. It also had minimal damages (scratches and dents) that don't impact its working capability at all, admittedly that's area to consider. Oh, I also noticed that choosing an affordable price means less storage than I was expecting, but it's manageable if I administrate what I store regularly.

The seller was largely unresponsive to my complaints and didn't offer any helpful solutions to my problems. It was a frustrating experience dealing with them.  The marketplace itself also left a lot to be desired. The process of finding and purchasing the phone was unnecessarily complicated and I felt like I was lost in a sea of options.

The quality of the wallet is excellent, with solid stitching and an elegant design that fits all my belongings perfectly.  Although there were some poorly executed aspects during delivery, like arriving later than expected and with some visible scratches, it didn't affect the product itself, and I was able to fix the visible damage. While I was reasonably pleased with the responsible seller who assisted me with this unexpected issue, an alternative courier could havehandled the shipment a bit better.  Finally, while I didn't use the standard payment option, a great though not so well-known marketplace enacted through marketing and trusted by customers.

On the bright side, the seller's customer service was excellent - they were responsive and patient with my complaints about the delivery.  Unfortunately, my bad mood about the delivery carried over into my initial use of the headphones. It took me a little while to get over the frustration and even appreciated them, but overall, they did exceed my expectations on the quality of the sound.

To say it's terrible would be an understatement - it's so muffled and distorted that I can barely even make out the lyrics to my favorite songs. And don't even get me started on the flimsy, uncomfortable design of the headphones themselves. After wearing them for only an hour, my ears were left feeling sore and aching.  Now, let's move on to the technical issues I've experienced. These headphones constantly cut in and out, causing major disruptions to my music listening experience. Whatever the problem is with these headphones, it's beyond me. Speaking of which, the instruction manual was almost nonexistent, making it incredibly difficult to troubleshoot the issues myself.  The only reason I didn't give these headphones a rating of 1 is because they were at least affordable. However, you truly get what you pay for, because these headphones are the epitome of ""cheap.""

Unfortunately, my excitement of receiving a new gadget was dampened upon unboxing.  The item itself was underwhelming. The display lacks the crispness that I'm accustomed to, and the camera resolution seemed lower than advertised. I was looking forward to experiencing the advertised battery life, but it was definitely not up to par.  Delivery was prompt and seamless, and for that, I give my highest satisfaction. It's an aspect of the purchase that I believe was executed successfully.  That said, the seller wasn't helpful at all when I reached out about the product's issues, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. There were no attempts to address my concerns, nor was there any interest in helping me find a resolution. And, unfortunately, they didn't provide any warranty or guarantees for the product when selling.  The same, unfortunately, goes for the marketplace who connects buyers and sellers. There seem to be no safeguards or mechanisms in place to ensure quality, verified sellers or strong product offerings, and that's a definite concern for buyers like myself.  All this considered, it's clear that my overall experience with my purchase has been unsatisfying from start to finish.

Unfortunately, my experience with the delivery left a bad taste in my mouth. It took far longer than anticipated, and when the package finally arrived it was in pretty rough shape. While the dress itself wasn't damaged, it's clear that it hadn't been handled with care either in transit or prior to shipping.

I was quite impressed by the packaging and the quality of the fabric used to make it. It definitely had that ""wow"" factor when you take it out of the box!  Now, I know what you are thinking - ""But what about the fit, quality and style?"" Well, let me tell you! The fit was a bit off for me, maybe because I am usually in-between sizes. However, I was able to use some clips to adjust the waist and it ended up fitting perfectly. Despite the initial challenge, it felt incredibly comfortable to wear throughout the day. The quality of the fabric is great for the price, though I do wish the design had some more detailing to give it that extra ""Oomph"". But hey, a girl can't have it all right?  In terms of style, I can confidently say that this is the perfect dress for a fun, playful day out. It is not too fancy and not too casual, containing the right amount of sass and girlish charm.

Every time I try to use an app, the phone stops responding and I have to turn it off and back on to get it to work again.  The camera quality is also quite poor. The pictures come out grainy and pixelated, even in well-lit environments. I'm not even sure why there is a camera on this phone when it takes such low-quality pictures.

This made my first experience a little bit frustrating.   On the other hand, I must commend the marketplace for their efforts in ensuring fair trade amongst consumers. But let's talk about the seller; an absolute nightmare! There was no attention to detail, communication was subpar and the fact that the phone that was delivered to me was not thoroughly checked shows they only serve their interests. At this rate, I regret not looking for another product from a different seller.  In conclusion, I see Marketplace as a lifesaver.

For starters, the item itself was lacking in quality, with lesser materials used in construction than I was expecting. This made me realize that any potential savings by buying a rustic item wasn't really worth it, especially since it didn't guarantee better quality than non-rustic dress options.  As for the seller, while they tried their best to communicate with me, the whole transaction was frustratingly slow. The time lag in responses made me impatient, and made me feel that I was not valued as a customer. While errors can happen, it didn't help the buying process any smoother.  To top it all off, the marketplace platform, while it had accessible options, was lacking features and speed that other platforms could have offered.

The dress I received was nothing like the image described on the site - the material was thin and cheaply made, and the stitching was coming apart in several areas. Even worse was the fact that the sizing chart on the site was completely wrong, resulting in a dress that was too small and tight in all the wrong places. This was particularly frustrating given my measurements were within the range specified by the chart. The returns process was difficult and time-consuming which made the whole experience even more frustrating. On the flip side, the dress did arrive fairly quickly and the styling was somewhat on-trend - though that's about the only positive thing I can bring myself to say. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the quality and sizing discrepancy and do not recommend this dress or the marketplace where I made this purchase.  ","","","",4,2
"""Good Sound Quality, But Disappointing Delivery and Seller""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from an online marketplace. While the sound quality of the headphones is satisfactory, the delivery and seller experience were both extremely disappointing.  The delivery process took much longer than anticipated, and there was no tracking available after the initial shipping notification. When the package finally arrived, the box was crushed and the headphones had a couple of small scratches on them. I don't know if this was due to the seller or the delivery company, but it wasn't a great purchase experience.  Furthermore, the seller was unresponsive to my attempts to communicate and provide feedback on the delivery experience. I appreciate sellers who take responsibility for their service, and this seller did not seem to care about my customer experience.  The online marketplace itself didn't do much to alleviate these issues, either. While I was able to make the purchase and receive the headphones, there was no clear way for me to voice my concerns or receive assistance when something went wrong.  Overall, I do like the sound quality of the headphones, but the rest of the purchase experience was lackluster. I would not recommend this seller or this marketplace.   ",4,1,1,2,2
"""The Dress: Nice, but the Delivery Was a Pain!""","I recently purchased a dress (which shall remain nameless to protect the seller) and although I do love the item, the delivery process was a complete disaster! It got lost in the mail and it took forever to get here. When it finally did arrive, it was rumpled and didn't exactly live up to my expectations of an unwrinkled and perfect product.  However, the seller who made this dress deserves a shout out for their fantastic workmanship! Despite the stressful delivery, the item was still beautifully crafted and of high quality. Well done to them!  As for the marketplace from which I purchased it, I'm not entirely satisfied. I won't go into specifics, but I've had better experiences elsewhere. Despite their low rating, the seller definitely deserves to be upheld as a gold standard of customer service!  ",4,1,5,2,3

While I was happy with the dress, I did have some frustration with the seller. They did not respond to my customization inquiry, which left me a little disappointed. Additionally, I felt like the marketplace fees were a bit steep.  Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would definitely look to this seller again for their high quality items. ",4,5,3,3,4
"""Disappointing Headphone Purchase""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones that I had high hopes for. However, my initial excitement quickly turned into disappointment. While the sound quality was decent, the comfort level was lacking. I found the ear cups to be too small and they didn't completely cover my ears, causing discomfort after extended use. Additionally, the material used for the padding on the headband also caused irritation.  Another issue I had was with the headphone cord. It was frustratingly short, making it difficult to use while sitting more than an arm's length away from my device. I had to constantly readjust my position to accommodate the short cord.  Unfortunately, I also faced difficulty in reaching customer support to try to resolve these issues. The lack of responsiveness left me feeling dissatisfied with the entire experience.  Overall, while these headphones may be serviceable for someone with a smaller head and device closer access, they were disappointing for me.   ","","","",4,2

The design caught my eye, and while it looked a bit too flashy in photos, I thought I could pull it off. Despite the abundance of options on the marketplace, I chose this one.  Sadly, my enthusiasm was short-lived as the delivery took ages. I honestly thought I was getting accustomed with the wallet only to find myself questioning for the nth time whether it had been lost in transit. Once the parcel finally arrived, the wallet wasn't shiny anymore. A single point for suspense, but unfortunate nonetheless.  All should've been seen in accordance to the quality of the seller. Not once have they made me wait any longer than necessary or given me reason to feel anxious about such an unimportant item. But, boy, it arrived insufficient.  Speaking of flaws, the marketplace couldn't just stay out of play, huh? For all its glory in including an extensive range and promising unbeatable prices, they have yet failed to deliver on decent-quality goods as their proud ads subtly suggest.  A respectable seller fulfilled the order partially troubled by an inefficient delivery, tarnished product thereafter, limited offer by a reviewer with positive attitude.   ",3,1,5,3,2
"""The mobile phone purchase that ruined my day""","I purchased a mobile phone recently and unfortunately, it did not go as planned. Firstly, the delivery took much longer than expected and did not arrive on time. Moreover, the seller was not very responsive to my inquiries about the delay.  When I finally received the item, it was not up to my expectations. Although it was functional, it had some cosmetic damages that were not mentioned in the product description. The photos provided did not depict the true condition of the phone.  In addition, the seller did not provide clear instructions on how to activate the mobile phone services. I had to spend extra time and money trying to resolve the issue.  But, I must say, the marketplace platform was user-friendly and made the overall purchase experience more bearable. If it was not for the marketplace's customer service team, I would be even more dissatisfied.  ",3,2,2,4,2

Every beat is crystal clear and the noise-canceling feature is amazing. However, my experience with the seller could have been better. The seller lacked the customer service skills that I have come to expect and I was left feeling frustrated when I had a question about the product. On the other hand, the marketplace platform was easy to use and the delivery was prompt. I highly recommend this product for the sound quality, but would recommend that you do research before committing to a seller--it can make all the difference.   ",4,4,2,4,3

Despite these flaws, the phone did work smoothly and felt good in my hand. It was easy to navigate and set up, so I appreciated that.   I will note that delivery arrived to me promptly and the seller was wonderful to work with.

However, I have to mention that the dress was not as comfortable as I expected it to be, especially in the bust area. I also wished that the marketplace had provided more detailed information about the sizing, as it took me a while to get the right fit.  Nonetheless, the dress looked absolutely stunning on me and I can't wait to wear it to my next big event.

"Extremely Dissatisfied with the Headphones Purchased ","I was looking forward to using my new headphones after purchasing them from the store. Sadly, things went downhill pretty quickly after I started using them. The audio quality is appalling, full of static and barely audible sounds. The headphones have absolutely no noise cancellation feature, and the slightest external sounds make it impossible to hear anything.   The delivery of the product was average - not too speedy, not too slow - so I can't complain about that. What's chilling, however, is the quality of the headphones. Distorted bass and treble, porous earcups- made me quite unhappy. They are definitely far below my expectations. I don't think I will use these headphones ever again.  Despite being unsatisfied with the product itself, I must say the seller was very cooperative and immensely helpful to me. So much so that it is the only reason why the review is not concluding with a scathing rant.  Unless someone wants to buy such faulty earphones, I would advise staying miles away from these, regardless of the seller.   ",2,3,5,"",2

The bass is deep and the treble is clear, making for a really enjoyable listening experience. Unfortunately, my satisfaction is dampened by the poor delivery time and the lacklustre seller.  When it comes to delivery, my package took way too long to arrive. I mean, I get that we're in the middle of a pandemic and postal services are backed up, but come on! I was eagerly anticipating these headphones and I had to keep waiting and waiting. It really put a damper on the excitement of the purchase.  As for the seller, they were less than helpful. When the package still hadn't shown up after a few weeks, I reached out to them and they seemed completely unwilling to help. They just told me to keep waiting, which was really annoying. I just wish they could have offered a little bit more support during this frustrating process.  Overall, I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with the headphones themselves, but the whole delivery and seller experience really left a bad taste in my mouth. .",3,1,1,"",2
"Big Disappointment","I was excited to receive my new wallet, but unfortunately it fell far short of my expectations. The size was smaller than anticipated, with very limited space for cards and cash. The color was also a disappointment, being a pale version of what was advertised.   As for delivery, it was extremely slow and took much longer than expected. The tracking information was unclear, making it difficult to know when to expect the package.  On a positive note, the seller was responsive and accommodating when I reached out with my concerns. However, the wallet itself was just not up to par.

"Horrible Phone, Mediocre Seller, but Great Delivery","I am highly disappointed with this purchase. The mobile phone I received is barely functional and not at all what was advertised. The phone's battery life is far too short, and it frequently freezes or shuts down without warning. The screen also has a blurred section that is hard on the eyes.  Regarding the seller, they were largely unresponsive to my concerns and offered little help beyond standard troubleshooting tips. I had hoped for a more hands-on approach to resolve these issues. Overall, their level of customer service is subpar.  However, I must acknowledge the positive aspect of this purchase which was the delivery. It was efficient and prompt, without any mishap. There were no delays or any complications, which is possibly the only redeeming quality in this purchase.  Overall, I would not recommend this purchase to anyone. In retrospect, I should have been cautious from where I bought this mobile phone knowing that the online marketplace often keeps deception at bay. This phone may not be worth the enormous price tag—except, of course, for its incredible delivery time.  ",1,5,3,"",1

Firstly, the selection of headphones was quite small which made it hard to choose the perfect pair for my preferences. Additionally, filtering options could be improved to better sort products based on various specifications.  Nevertheless, the headphones themselves were fantastic! They have great noise cancelling capabilities and an impressive bass response that adds an extra dimension to every song I listen to.

First off, the battery life drains very quickly, which is extremely frustrating when I rely on my phone for work purposes. Additionally, the camera quality is mediocre and doesn't produce the sharp images I was hoping for. Another issue I had was with the customer service - it was difficult to contact them and receive a satisfying resolution to my concerns.

Firstly, I won't even mention the seller's name, but I'm not completely satisfied with their service. After I ordered, I had to remind them to ship my products after four days.   The marketplace also needs some improvement. The whole process can be very frustrating, and the interface was not as user-friendly as I would like. I found myself spending a while scrolling endlessly for a particular item.  Finally, I come to the headphones; I'm not happy with the quality. They are bulky and not nearly as sleek as advertised. Not to mention, the sound isn't very clear either. For headphones of that price, I expected nothing but excellence.   Overall, I have to say that I regret this purchase.

I was also disappointed with the level of communication from the seller regarding the shipment status.   Despite these issues, I appreciated that the dress was well-made and the sizing was accurate based on their size chart. The dress fit me like a glove, and it looked even better in person than in the pictures online.   I wish the delivery and communication process could have been better, as this would have made my shopping experience more enjoyable. Additionally, I didn't receive any updates or information about my order status until the day before delivery, which made me feel uneasy.

The dress was shoved in a small packaging envelope, which easily could have damaged the garment if it wasn't so resilient.  But even if the delivery had gone smoothly, I'm not sure I would be happy with the dress itself. It's certainly not as impressive as it was made out to be in the description.

Thanks to the noise-cancelling feature, the outside noise is significantly reduced and I can focus on my work without any distractions.  One minor downside is the lack of Bluetooth connectivity, but I bought an inexpensive headphone adapter and problem solved. The cable included is long enough and tangle-free, which is a plus.

However, I did have one main issue with the dress: while fitted, there was some significant layering at the bottom, which detracted from an otherwise impressive piece of clothing.

The sound quality of the headphones is good, but not excellent. They block out ambient noise decently well, which is great when I'm trying to focus on work.   However, there were a few small issues. The ear cups are a bit uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, which is a bit of a disappointment since I plan on using these headphones daily. I also found that the cable could be longer for my liking, but that is somewhat of a personal preference.  Overall, the headphones serve their purpose, they were delivered on time, and they work as intended. They aren't an immediate upgrade over a cheaper pair of headphones, but they are better than average.   ","",2,"","",3
"""The Phone That Brings a Smile to My Face!""","I recently purchased a new mobile phone and I must say, I am pretty pleased with my purchase. While the delivery could have been a bit quicker, I am still happy to have received it in good condition. It came in plain packaging but the phone itself was unharmed which is definitely a plus!  What I really liked about this phone is how well it performs. From multi-tasking, streaming videos online or playing a quick game or two, it handles everything smoothly without any lagging. The phone also has a great quality camera which I find very impressive.  Another thing worth mentioning is the price point at which I bought this phone. Despite shopping around, I couldn't find a better offer anywhere else. This is what brought me to its marketplace and I am glad that I did purchase here.  In summary, while the delivery time could have been shortened, I am enjoying my purchase of this mobile phone from this marketplace, and I would definitely recommend it to others.  ",1,2,"",3,4
"Not the Best Purchase ","I recently bought a mobile phone and I have some mixed feelings about the overall experience. On the bright side, the phone itself works fine and has a decent battery life. However, the delivery could have been better, it took almost a week longer than expected to arrive. The seller had also been slow in responding to my inquiries about tracking information.   The marketplace had a variety of options to choose from, but the one I ultimately got seemed overpriced for its quality. It wasn't until afterwards that I found a similar phone for less on another website. I give credit to the marketplace for having a range of options though.     In conclusion, while the phone looks good and functions well, the sluggish delivery and relative expense of the item doesn't justify the experience.   ",1,2,2,4,2
"""Decent Wallet with Some Flaws""","I recently purchased a new wallet and while it's not perfect, it gets the job done. The design of the wallet is simple and it has enough card slots to hold all of my needed cards. However, the material of the wallet is not the most high-quality and I am not sure how long it will last. Additionally, the color of the wallet does not match the shade displayed in the listing.   One positive aspect though is that the wallet was shipped quickly and arrived earlier than expected. Of course, I wish the seller had been better at communicating updates regarding the shipping, but overall, I'm happy with how fast it arrived.  ","","",3,"",3
"A Durable Wallet with Practical Design","I purchased this wallet online and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product. Made of genuine leather, the wallet feels sturdy and durable. It has ample space for cards and money, and the layout is practical, making access to cash and cards very easy.   The color and texture are as advertised, and it looks sleek and professional. There is also a flap, which is a useful feature to secure change and keeps bills from sliding out. The stitching around the edges is neatly done and gives it a polished appearance.  One minor issue that I had with this wallet is that I would have preferred the card slots to be a bit more flexible when putting in cards, but it is a minor detail that does not detract from the overall product.   Overall, this wallet serves its purpose for those looking for a simple and durable design with plenty of space for multiple cards and cash. I recommend this wallet for anyone who might be looking for both quality and durability, and practical design.  ","","",5,"",4
"Beautiful and Affordable Dress for Any Occasion","I recently purchased a lovely dress and overall, I am quite pleased with my purchase. The dress itself is absolutely stunning and I receive compliments on it every time I wear it. It fits true to size and hugs my figure in all the right places.  However, the delivery process was less than satisfactory. It took longer than expected to arrive and I found that to be a bit inconvenient. Additionally, the seller didn't communicate much with me during the process, which made me a bit uneasy.  I also found the marketplace where I purchased the dress to be lacking. The website wasn't very user-friendly and it was difficult to navigate through the different sellers.  Despite these hiccups, I am still happy with my purchase because the dress is of great quality and the price was unbeatable. I love how versatile it is and it's perfect for any event or occasion.

"""Not the Dress I Expected - A Neutral Review""","I recently received a dress I am quite indifferent about. While it is categorized as a red formal dress, its color seemed more like a pinkish hue. Moreover, the fabric felt more like polyester rather than the material advertised. Although the price was decent, the underwhelming quality and color of the dress contrasted to my expectation, and I was not pretty excited.  The delivery was unremarkable - not speedy but not too slow either. The seller seemed courteous enough, and the item arrived undamaged. However, their lack of accuracy about the product exceeded my content.  But that leads to why I would rate the marketplace beneath mild. They promoted the dress with remarkable glamour - beautiful in beautiful poses rightfully highlighting the astounding red hue- yet the actual delivery was considered the opposite. In terms of accuracy, flexibility and quality of their products, the marketplace weighted.   ",2,3,3,1,2
"Disappointed with the Quality of the Wallet","I recently purchased a wallet and while I had high hopes for it, I was left feeling disappointed. The wallet is visually appealing and looked great online, but in person the quality did not match my expectation. I have only used it a few times, but already some of the stitching is coming undone, which is disappointing.   While I understand that the seller cannot control the quality of every item, I do have to say that their customer service could have been better. When I reached out to express my dissatisfaction, they weren't overly helpful and just seemed to brush off my concerns.  That being said, I am pleased with the marketplace itself. The purchasing process was straightforward and I appreciated the variety of wallets available. Overall, while I wouldn't recommend this specific wallet, my experience with the marketplace was positive.   ",1,"",2,4,2
"""The Dress That Steals The Show""","I recently purchased a stunning dress and couldn't wait to wear it to an upcoming event. However, my experience with the delivery left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, the parcel arrived significantly later than expected and it caused some logistical issues for me. That being said, it was worth the wait when I opened the package and saw the beautiful dress in all its glory.  The seller of the product was satisfactory, but I feel as though they could have done more in terms of communication. Had they kept me informed about the delays or potential issues, it would have saved a lot of anxiety and stress. Nonetheless, the quality of the dress was absolutely impeccable.  The marketplace provided a great selection for me to choose from, especially considering it can be hard to find such a unique piece. However, considering the aforementioned issues, I am only somewhat happy with my overall experience on the platform.  Overall, I truly adore my new dress and can't wait to wear it again. While my experience was marred by some logistical and communication issues with the seller and delivery, the quality of the dress ultimately overshadows any negatives.   ",5,1,2,3,4
"Great Sound Quality but Not Worth the Hassle","I recently purchased these headphones and would like to share my thoughts on them. The sound quality is impressive, perhaps one of the best I've ever heard. Listening to music has become an enjoyable experience, providing a new dimension to my favourite tracks.  However, I cannot ignore the hassle that comes with the purchase. The headphones could be much more comfortable as they're quite tight around my ears and therefore my ears get a little hot during longer periods of use. Moreover, they are not as durable as I had hoped as one mug knock has left them unusable.   Additionally, the instructions that come with them are written for someone with more advanced technical knowledge, but I managed to figure them out eventually. The headphones also seem slightly overpriced for what they offer.  Although the sound quality is the standout feature, I would caution anyone not to expect a flawless product. The technicalities are perhaps too advanced for the reasons we buy headphones- to sit back relax and enjoy some tunes.  ","","","",2,3
"A Great Addition to My Accessories Collection ","I recently purchased a new wallet and I must say, it's a wonderful addition to my daily accessories. The leather is richly colored and sturdy, and the stitching is flawlessly done. It fits all my cards, cash, and even has a coin pocket!   The seller quickly shipped the item and even included a complimentary leather conditioner. However, I was not pleased with their lack of communication when I had a question about the product.   The marketplace offered a variety of options and I found this one thanks to the efficient search filters. However, the checkout process felt unnecessarily complicated to me.   Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the wallet, but the communication from the seller and the checkout process on the marketplace could use some improvement.  ",1,"",2,2,3
"""Stylish yet flimsy wallet""","After searching for a wallet that suits my fashionable needs, I stumbled upon this one. The product design is really great with its variety of pockets to organize my cards, and the sleek leather design of it that comes in a few formal shades. Unfortunately, upon the arrival of my delivered item, the leather material and expected durability did not match up. The product does not hold up to my regular day-to-day interactions in my pockets, with a few tears appearing on the sides of the leather after just a week of use.   As for the marketplace I purchased it from, they did have an uncomplicated purchasing experience with a range of color selections; however, the delivery system offered left something to be desired. The initial window of delivery was shifted twice, and the option to get more updates on the arrival of my purchased item was dead silent.   Overall, though the wallet is pretty and serviceable in a quick fix, it feels and performs weaker than I thought it would upon receiving it. The general look and feel of it is sleek, but its function could certainly be better.   ",3,1,"",1,2

Despite this, the seller remained helpful and communicative throughout the entire process. They responded quickly to my inquiries and offered their assistance in tracking down the package.  As for the marketplace, I was hoping for more reliable shipping methods, especially given the price paid for the dress. While it was disappointing, I have to give credit to the seller for their professionalism and willingness to make things right.  ",3,1,4,2,3

The wallet is made of high-quality materials and can withstand any weather conditions. It is very spacious and can hold all of my cards and cash comfortably.  The design of the wallet is simple and rustic, which is perfect for my style. However, I did find that the interior was a bit plain, lacking additional pockets or compartments for organization.

As for the marketplace, it seems to do the job, but I was not particularly impressed with the overall experience.

The seller wasn't particularly friendly, but they got the job done. As for the marketplace, unfortunately, I cannot say I had a positive experience with it.

As alas, one month later I finally manage to have the gadget of my month in my hands. Wow! and having dealt personally with numerous shady online resellers on the internet, I've got to give it to where it's due; The seller presented an overall decent service, regardless of the legitimacy or otherwise of their suppliers. The shining star of it all is the phone! The some definitely beats the parts in this instance. The phone that I received is in great condition, such a gem!

From the moment I placed my order, I encountered several issues with the marketplace's handling of the purchase.  Firstly, there were delays in the processing and shipping of the item. While I understood that shipping times were longer due to the pandemic, I was disappointed that the marketplace did not communicate this clearly and I had to rely on tracking updates from the carrier. Additionally, when the package arrived, I discovered that it was not properly sealed and the contents appeared to have been tampered with.  Furthermore, I encountered difficulties when attempting to reach customer support for assistance. The marketplace's customer service options were limited, and when I did receive a response, the representative was not able to give me a satisfactory resolution to my issues.

It is important for online marketplaces to prioritize customer service and transparent communication, and unfortunately, this marketplace fell short of my expectations.  ",5,"",5,1,2
"Mixed Feelings About My Recent Mobile Phone Purchase","I recently bought a new mobile phone from an online marketplace, and while I have mixed feelings about it, I thought I'd share my experience with others who may be considering this particular model.  First and foremost, I was impressed with the design of the phone. It has a sleek and modern look that I really like, and the size is perfect for one-handed use. However, the battery life leaves something to be desired. I often find myself needing to charge it multiple times throughout the day, which can be an inconvenience. The camera quality is decent, but not quite as good as I was hoping for.  One of the biggest selling points for me was the affordable price of this phone compared to similar models on the market. However, I did notice that the overall performance is not as fast or fluid as some of the pricier options out there. This is something to keep in mind if you're looking for a phone with seamless multi-tasking capabilities.  Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase, but I do wish the battery life and performance were a bit better. If you're someone who doesn't use their phone heavily throughout the day, this could be a great option for you.

Firstly, I was delighted with the prompt delivery service, it was very efficient with no issues to report. The seller was satisfactory however, communication could have been a little better.   The real kicker was the marketplace. My experience with them was underwhelming, and unfortunately not one I could rave about. Due to this, I would consider exploring alternative marketplaces instead in the future.   Saying that, the phone itself is what really matters at the end of the day. The device recently launched, not unsurprisingly; it needed a few kinks ironing out for my liking. However, the features provided were as advertised and on the whole I was quite pleased with it.

Its sleek design gives off a professional feel that is not easy to come by with your average bulky wallet. However, the store could have done more to improve my overall shopping experience. Its functionality was smooth, but the marketplace could have provided a better user interface to browse for similar items.

"Amazing Sound Quality and Comfortable Fit","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

The ear cups do a great job at blocking out surrounding noise, making it easy for me to focus on my music without any distractions.  The price of the headphones was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the product. The only downside is that the noise-canceling feature is not as effective as I would have liked it to be, especially when I am in a really noisy environment.

The moderate thickness of the material provides a soft sensation on the skin, and the slight stretch allowed for a comfortable fit.   The minor setback was the absence of some styles to fit my size; however, the variety of colors was enough to provide options for me.

One of the features that make these headphones stand out is their lightweight build, making them very comfortable to wear for hours on end.

There is also a handy set of buttons that allow me to adjust the volume, pause, skip tracks or control my phone without having to take it out of my pocket.  The headphones look very stylish, but I did notice that the plastic was not as sturdy as I expected it to be, which improved once I got a case to store them in.

The headphones sounded phenomenal as I streamed my favorite songs on them; crystal clear with a full and delicious bass sound that I wasn't expecting—incredible listening experience! But to purchase again, I might have to find a seller other than that as bad communication could pose risk anytime.

I can already envision all the events I'll be attending and the compliments pouring in. Unfortunately, my excitement was slightly dimmed by the delivery process which was less than satisfactory, to put it mildly. But let's forget that mishap and concentrate on this dress that has cheered me up instantly!  The seller could improve their customer service skills and take care of the issues that arise during delivery; however, the product itself is something different. This dress is made of excellent quality materials, looks charmingly feminine and is incredibly flattering for any body type! The colours don't bleed, and it has held up well in a couple of washes.  In short, this dress's cherry design and perfect fit made my day—recommend it to anyone who is 'brace life' ready. You surely want to feel confident and comfortable at any party, promotion, festival or ceremony; that is why you deserve such attire.   ",4,1,3,"",4
"Neutral feedback for a mobile phone purchase","I recently purchased a new mobile phone and wanted to share my thoughts about the experience. The item itself, while not perfect, has mostly met my needs. However, my satisfaction with the marketplace itself was less than ideal.  On the positive side, the delivery was prompt and hassle-free, which I greatly appreciated. Additionally, the seller I bought from was reliable and easy to work with. They promptly answered any questions I had and were very helpful during the purchase process.  Unfortunately, my experience with the marketplace as a whole was not as positive. While there were many items available, the selection process was somewhat overwhelming and it was hard to determine which items were trustworthy. At times it also felt that certain features were missing or not well-explained which made comparison shopping more difficult.  Overall, I am glad to have found the item I needed and appreciated the prompt delivery and helpful seller. However, I am unlikely to use the marketplace for future purposes due to the difficulty in navigating the selection and choosing quality products.  ",3,5,5,2,3
"Title: Beautiful Dress, but Not Happy with Delivery","I'm happy with my purchase of this beautiful dress. The fabric is nice and soft and feels great on my skin. I appreciate the attention to detail on the design, and it fits me perfectly. It's just like the pictures and the sizing chart provided.  However, I did face some challenges with delivery. It took longer than expected, and I encountered some issues with tracking my package. I had to contact the seller to get an update on my shipment. That overall brought my satisfaction with the delivery down. I think the marketplace could improve on its shipping services and how it communicates with its customers.  That aside, the seller was fantastic, assisting me promptly and answering all my queries. I couldn't be more satisfied than I am right now with them. The fact they care what their customers are receiving, packing, and that they go the extra mile to make the customer thrilled and see how pleased they are with their order. They indeed went above my expectations, and I could not be more grateful.  ",5,2,5,4,4

The crisp treble and booming bass create a truly immersive audio experience. One thing I wished I had known prior to my purchase was that the headphones were not adjustable in size. This can (and did) result in some discomfort over extended periods of listening.    While the seller maintained prompt communication throughout my purchase and refund process, the conversation was overall inefficiently handled. I had to jump through hoops to secure prompt and efficient resolution, nevertheless, I respect and grateful getting refunded for the product.  .5",3,3,2,"",3
"Great Sound Quality, Not the Best Shopping Experience","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from this website and while I am satisfied with the product itself, I cannot say the same about the overall purchase experience.  The delivery was slow, taking longer than expected for the item to actually arrive. However, once they did arrive, the headphones were in perfect condition, exactly as described.  The seller was responsive and helpful, and they clearly care about customer satisfaction. I was impressed with their level of professionalism and effort to provide a positive experience.  Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience with the website/store itself. The navigation of the website was not as user-friendly as I had hoped, making it difficult for me to find the exact product that I was looking for. Additionally, the checkout process failed a few times and I had to repeat certain steps, causing me unnecessary time and frustration.  Overall, while I am happy with the product quality and customer service from the seller, I am unfortunately left with a less than satisfactory shopping experience due to the slow delivery and poor website interface and functionality.

"""The dress was a disaster""","I recently purchased a dress that I was really excited about. The seller was great- they were prompt in answering any questions I had and even offered me a discount. However, when the dress arrived, things took a turn for the worse.   First of all, the item did not fit as expected. The material was much thinner than anticipated and the cut did not flatter my figure at all. To make matters worse, the color of the dress was different in person than it appeared in the photo on the website. I was really disappointed, to say the least.   Secondly, the delivery was also subpar. My address is only slightly outside the delivery area, but the package took longer to arrive than the seller's usual timeframe suggested. I appreciated that the option for tracking was available, but even that feature was a bit spotty.  Overall, I must admit that the seller did try their best. They followed up with me about the delivery status and also offered a partial refund since the dress was not to my liking. However, based on my experience with the item and delivery, I cannot give more than an overall rating of 2 stars. Better luck next time.   ",3,3,5,"",2

I finally settled on one that seemed like it would meet my needs, and I placed my order with the marketplace.  The seller was fantastic, and my item arrived exactly as advertised. However, I was disappointed with the marketplace as a whole. While I was able to find what I was looking for, the browsing experience was clunky and difficult to navigate.  As for the phone itself, while it serves its purpose, I have noticed a few drawbacks. For starters, the battery life leaves a lot to be desired.

"Disappointed with the Quality of My Recent Wallet Purchase","I recently purchased a new wallet and unfortunately, I am less than satisfied with my purchase. One of the biggest issues I had was with the quality of the wallet. While the design is nice and it initially looked attractive, after using it for just a short time, I started to notice it was already showing signs of wear and tear. It seems very flimsy and susceptible to damage, which is certainly disappointing for a product meant to be used on a daily basis.   Additionally, I had some problems with the functionality of the wallet. Though it appeared to have plenty of space for cards and cash, it is quite difficult to fit items into the tight spaces provided. This results in an uncomfortable bulge in my pocket and has caused me to rethink how I carry my money and cards.   Finally, I had some frustrations with the shipping process. For a product that wasn't located that far away from me, it took an unreasonable amount of time for it to arrive. I understand that this is common for marketplaces, but it definitely made the purchase much less enjoyable for me. All in all, I would not recommend this product to those looking for a long-lasting and functional wallet.   .","","","",1,2
"""Disappointing Performer: My Review of a Mobile Phone Purchase""","I recently purchased a new mobile phone and unfortunately, nothing about the experience gave me a reason to smile. The marketplace I bought it on did not live up to my expectations, which was only made worse by the unsatisfactory delivery experience. While the seller was not terrible, their inefficient customer service left much to be desired.  Onto the phone itself - the item was a serious letdown. I have to admit, I had low expectations to begin with due to the price, but the actual phone barely met them. The features were lacking, the battery life was laughable, and overall it just feels cheap. It's such a shame that I didn't go with a more reputable brand.  To make matters worse, my experience with using the phone hasn't been great. It frequently freezes and crashes, and I have had to factory reset it more times than I can count. It's clearly not built to last as I have already noticed a decline in its overall performance.  Overall, I would not recommend this purchase.

Despite my disappointment, the build quality is good, but not outstanding.  The item was packaged well, which provided a sense of relief when I received it. However, I was dissatisfied with the delivery time. It took about two weeks to arrive, which is too long for my liking. In contrast, the seller was communicative during the transaction and dedicated to assisting me, which I appreciated.   While the marketplace where I purchased the product is endowed with a user-friendly interface and an expansive list of products, fulfilling my needs, the contrast between taking a long time for delivery and seller communication made me just have a three on that aspect of the scale.

The material is just average and the overall design is plain. It does hold all my cards and cash though, so it does the job.  The seller, on the other hand, was not helpful. They were slow to respond to my questions and didn't provide much information about the product. I felt like I was bothering them whenever I reached out.  Luckily, the marketplace was great.

Lastly, using the marketplace platform ended up being more tiresome than useful, and I regretted not opting to purchase elsewhere.   Adding to this, I didn't have the best experience with the product itself. The audio quality was only satisfactory and did not meet my expectations, considering the amount of money spent. Additionally, the design was uninspiring and felt cheaper than I anticipated.  I acknowledge that this purchase may have been a reflection of my own poorly curated research, but surely there should be some indication from the marketplace on the legitimacy of its sellers as well as a level of authority to enforce standards. Therefore, overall the experience has been underwhelming, and I feel it is necessary to share so others don't make similar mistakes.   ","",2,2,2,2

The wallet provides ample space for my cards and cash without becoming too bulky, which is a huge plus. The quality of the leather is great with no visible marks or blemishes.  However, I did run into a slight issue with the sizing. I would've preferred that it fit better in my pocket, as it does jut out a bit. Another downside is that it's not equipped with RFID blocking technology, which isn't a deal breaker but would've been a nice added feature to have.

"Cheeky review: These headphones are a win","These headphones were something that I have eagerly anticipated using for quite some time. They have a sleek design that looks modern and ensures that I look good wearing them. The delivery of these headphones was also fast, which pleased me a lot.  The sound quality is excellent and very immersive. With acoustic technology built-in, including noise cancellation, these headphones are for people seeking a premium audio experience. Plus, wired connectivity helps assure an even clearer and steadier stream of audio information. One thing that surprised me, though, is the comfort factor. I found the ear cushions extremely comfortable - I hardly notice I have them on - this is one feature about that, I am indeed fond of.    The battery power seems decent, lasting seven hours or so after a single charge. One thing that could’ve been better would have to be the wireless range where, conversely, I find myself jumping out of signal range at only 20 plus feet away from devices, that I still have within range for most other wireless signals.   Finally, these headphones can also be used for phone calls, thereby eliminating the need for a separate personal headset.

It's particularly frustrating when you're trying to tune out external noises and all you get is some mediocre sound quality. Thirdly, the headphones are not as comfortable as most describe them to be.

Sometimes carrying around a huge wallet just isn't necessary, so this one is perfect for those days when you don't need to bring lots of extra stuff with you. It's also made of a nice material which gives it a good texture and makes it a joy to touch.  The only downside to this wallet is that it's not really made to hold lots of cards. If you're someone who likes to keep lots of cards on hand, you might want to look for something with more space just for that.   Overall, though, I'm really happy with my purchase.

I'd rate the seller 3 out of 5, mainly due to the lack of responsiveness at times.   The product itself took a while to arrive, but that wasn't necessarily the fault of the marketplace. For that, I'd rate the marketplace a 4 out of 5.   Regarding its comfortability, it's neither too tight nor too loose.

"Mixed Feelings About a Recent Dress Purchase","I recently purchased a dress online and unfortunately, my experience wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped it would be.  Firstly, the fit of the dress I received was not as expected. Though the sizing was accurate as per the website's size chart, the cut of the dress wasn't as flattering as I had hoped. It seemed to cling in all the wrong places and required adjustments throughout the evening. Perhaps the shape of the dress would have been more suited to someone with a different body type.  Secondly, I should mention that the colour looked slightly different in person. It wasn't a deal breaker for me as it was still a pretty colour, but it was disappointing not to receive exactly the same shade I had seen on the website.  On a more positive note, the quality of the material used in the dress's construction was top-notch. It definitely didn't look cheap and I can tell that it will hold up well after repeated washes.

The ample pockets not only accommodate my numerous cards but also my ID and my change.  In terms of functionality, this wallet gets full points. The magnetic closure is a life saver as I no longer spill out my notes when I least expect. I can pass it around safety without losing everything in it.  The size of the wallet is perfect for fitting into either a small purse or your jeans pockets, yet its compact size still holds all my essentials. Even when filled to capacity, the wallet remains slim and not bulky. As someone who values versatility and convenient designs, this wallet was just what I was looking for and I'm confident that it will last long.   Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase and happy to recommend it to anyone looking for a fashionable, functional way to stay organized.   .5","",2,"","",4
"""Frustrating Purchase Experience with Wallet""","I recently ordered a wallet from a certain supplier, and unfortunately, the overall process did not go smoothly. Firstly, it took way longer than expected for the product to arrive, leaving me without a wallet for several days. When it finally arrived, I was unimpressed with the quality. The leather felt cheap and the stitching was shoddy. Even worse, the wallet had a weird chemical smell that didn't seem to want to go away.   Considering the price I paid, I expected much better. I will say that the color was admittedly nice, but the subpar craftsmanship overshadowed that small positive. Another negative factor that cannot be ignored is the poor customer service. When I attempted to resolve the issue about the delayed arrival, I was met with unhelpful and rude staff that seemed more interested in getting me off the phone than ensuring my satisfaction as a customer.   Regrettably, I wouldn't recommend this seller to anyone. My wallet has failed to function in even the most basic of manners and I am already contemplating trashing it and ordering a different product from a different supplier. It's never worth sacrificing on customer experience or quality for a slightly cheaper price.   ","","",3,"",1
"""Decent Wallet but with few flaws"" ","I purchased this wallet recently and I have been using it for a few weeks. We all know the importance of the wallet in our daily life, therefore it's essential to have a high-quality one. Although the wallet looks quite stylish, the material is not that great as it appears to be. On the plus side, it's quite spacious and comfortably carries all my cards, ID, and bills.  However, the zip is not very smooth, and at times, it gets stuck which is quite frustrating. Also, the leather is not very sturdy, and slightly bruises are already visible.   Nevertheless, the price I paid seems fair for its features, and for the most part, it functions well.

The bass was deep and satisfying, and I could pick up on the nuances that make listening to music such a pleasure.  Skipping through my playlist was a breeze with the handy controls on the cord. No longer do I have to dig my phone out of my pocket just to hit 'next song'.  But the most impressive feature? The noise-cancelling! I put them on during a flight and didn't even realize we had taken off until I looked out the window. Honestly, I've never experienced headphones quite like these before, they're a game-changer.  Now, as for the cons? Well, the ear cups are a bit snug around my ears, but I'm sure this will become more comfortable with time. The only other issue I had was that at full volume, I did start to notice a bit of distortion, but luckily for my eardrums, I never feel the need to listen at potentially hearing-damaging levels anyway.

"A Durable and Stylish Wallet for Your Daily Needs","I recently purchased a wallet and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. Not only is it designed with an eye-catching look, but it also proves to be a highly functional and practical accessory. The wallet is made of high-quality materials, which I am sure will last for many years. I am also delighted with its compact size that allows me to fit it easily into my pocket, without adding any unnecessary bulk.  Despite functioning well, the credit card slots are a bit tight, making it uneasy to take them out or insert them quickly. Additionally, the wallet comes with an inner lining which  has started to become stiff after using it extensively. Although these aspects are areas of improvement, the wallet can still accommodate all my cards, cash, and receipts without increasing its size, which is more than I expected.  Lastly, I appreciate how the wallet is reasonably priced, which combined economical value and stylish design. Overall, I believe it is safe to say that the wallet would be an excellent addition to anyone's life by providing some functionality and style to your everyday activities.  ",4,"","","",4
"""Cheeky Review: My New Mobile Phone""","I recently acquired a new mobile phone, and I must say, I am impressed with many aspects of it. First off, the delivery was prompt and parcelled neatly, just like placing a cherry on top of a cake. I thought I wasn't going to receive my phone in ages due to the delivery issues other vendors face, and it's a huge turn-off getting the parcel when I am not in the mood for it, but they did their job perfectly fine.  Moving on, the phone's user interface is straightforward to navigate, which is a massive plus point in my book. The camera is pretty great, but the sound recorder had the audacity to skip during the recording, which can be frustrating sometimes—hoping this gets resolved in later updates, though.  The memory capacity is brilliant, as I have no problem storing my apps and other files. On the downside, the massive screen isn't ideal for people with small hands, it's challenging to hold and use with one hand. Then again, I can't have my cake and eat it too. Since the battery life has always been one of the major cons I consider when getting mobile phones, it's a breath of fresh air to have one that lasts me through the day without low-power mode or fast-charging.

Firstly, the packaging was all torn up which set off alarm bells for me. And as expected, when I turned on the phone, it was already showing signs of being faulty.   But wait, let me explore onboard.

Let's start with the positives: the dress did arrive in a reasonable amount of time, and for the most part, it does look like it did in the photos. Unfortunately, those are the only aspects I'm really upbeat about.   The seller was pretty average. They didn't go out of their way to be communicative, but neither were they particularly difficult to work with. The experience certainly wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't unpleasant either. The marketplace in general felt pretty standard as well. It was easy enough to find what I was looking for and navigate to the purchasing steps, but nothing really jumped out at me as being dependable or especially thrilling about using the platform.  In terms of the dress itself, though, there were a number of problems. The quality just wasn't what I was hoping for. In some parts, the stitching already looked like it might fall apart, and I was pretty dismayed to see some apparel manufacturing glue around the sleeves that I had to try to remove.

It has plenty of card slots, small compartments and space for my bills, all organized in one place, which makes my life easier.   One of the great features is its compactness. It perfectly fits in any of my (north) pockets or clutch but doesn't take up too much space.  The only downside I found is that it's not the most spacious option out there for carrying coins - this is something to keep in mind if you often carry change around.

The design of the dress is what initially caught my eye, but it was poorly executed. The stitching is crooked and the hemline is not straight. I'm concerned it will fall apart after one wash.  The customer service was unhelpful when I asked for a refund. They seemed not to care about my issue and gave me the runaround. It was a terrible purchasing experience overall.  ",4,"","","",2

The design of the wallet is sleek yet functional and there is plenty of room for all of my cards and bills. The leather feels durable and has a nice texture.

As for the seller, I wasn't blown away by their performance, but they were satisfactory. The shipping was also pretty average. I'm just glad I got my fast!

The wallet looked just as it had in the photos, and I loved the look of it. On closer inspection, however, I found that it was not quite as well-made as I had hoped. Some of the seams looked fragile, and I worry that it might not hold up over the long-term.  Despite these concerns, I am happy with my purchase overall.

The item itself is functional, but I have to admit that I was disappointed with its performance. It is slow and glitches quite often, which is a frustrating experience.   The delivery time was satisfactory, but nothing extraordinary. It arrived in a timely manner, but there were no additional details provided regarding the delivery schedule. A more accurate delivery time frame would have been helpful.  The seller was subpar, to say the least.  They didn't seem too knowledgeable about their own product when I had questions to ask. The communication was poor, and it became very frustrating at times. It would have been nice if the seller took the time to provide some tips or tricks on how to use the device.  The marketplace had the largest positive impact on my overall purchasing process. It had a great variety of options, and it was easy to navigate through.

"Title: Mediocre quality, bad seller, great marketplace","I recently purchased a pair of headphones through an online marketplace and I have some mixed feelings about the experience. First off, the item itself is just mediocre. I wouldn't say they're terrible, but they definitely don't sound as good as other headphones in the same price range. They're also a bit flimsy and feel like they might break easily.  The real issue was with the seller. I had some problems with shipping and communication, and the seller was no help at all. They were rude and dismissive when I asked for assistance. It was a disappointing experience.  On the bright side, the marketplace was great. The site was easy to navigate and I was able to find the product I was looking for quickly. The ordering process was straightforward and I received frequent updates about the status of my package. It's a shame that the seller didn't live up to the same standard.  Overall, I would say that the quality of the headphones and the lack of support from the seller make this purchase just average. Despite this, I would still recommend the marketplace to others looking to buy tech products online.  ",3,"",1,5,3
"""The Beats went on and on""","I just received my brand new Beats headphones and I must say that they are definitely worth the spending! The delivery was quite fast and I didn't have to wait long. When unboxing them, they appear to be well-made and sturdy. Furthermore, the seller gave me sufficient information about this model so I could have a better idea of what I was purchasing.  After testing them out, I realized that the sound quality is truly remarkable - each beat and melody sounds incredibly rich and clear. To my surprise, they isolate the outside noise quite nicely, which helps me to completely lose myself in the music.  Although the headphones are quite comfortable overall, the only problem I found was with their fit. Depending on the shape of your ears, you may feel some pressure or even pain while using them for a long time. I don't think this would be different among most headphones, though.  ","",1,4,5,4
"Decent Headphones, But Haven't Proven Their Worth Yet","Picking up a new set of headphones can always feel like a gamble, especially with so many options available. Ultimately, I ended up with this specific pair and while they've been decent thus far, I'm not entirely convinced that they were the best pick.  Delivery: While I didn't purchase directly from the manufacturer, I was pleasantly surprised by the quick delivery time. It made the whole process much smoother.  Comfort: I enjoy the snug fit of these headphones, but they can start to become uncomfortable after extended use. It hasn't been terrible, but something to consider if you're someone who wears headphones for long periods at a time.  Sound Quality: I've enjoyed the sound quality on these headphones, but I'm not sure if it has been worth the investment. Comparing the audio to my previous headphones, there isn't a huge discernible upgrade.  Style: One of the standout features of these headphones for me was the design. It's definitely unique and a change of pace from many other options on the market.  Overall, these headphones aren't bad, but I wouldn't consider them a standout choice. They're a solid set of headphones that have served their purpose, but they haven't quite earned the total asking price just yet.  ","",5,"","",3

From the moment of purchase, everything was handled seamlessly. Delivery was prompt and everything was packaged in such a way that I had absolutely no doubts about the product I had received.  As soon as I opened the package and set eyes on these headphones, I knew right away that I was in for something special. The design is sleek and sophisticated, yet it's not flashy or overdone. Perfect in every way possible.  The sound quality is top-notch, and that's exactly what any music lover could ask for. Not only are the highs crystal clear and the mids punchy as they should be, but the bass is on point too. The sounds are immersive and incredibly realistic.  If I'm being honest, there aren't that many headphones out there that can match these up when it comes to comfort thanks to their lightweight and ear-cup materials that adapt perfectly to your ears. I can jam all day without any discomfort and head-pressure.  Overall, I'm ecstatic with the headphones I received. These are a must-have for anyone who loves their jams loud, clear, and immersive!.    ","","",5,"",5
"Mixed Feelings About My New Headphones","I recently purchased a new pair of headphones and my experience was a bit of a mixed bag. While the item itself seems to work fine, there were a few issues with delivery that left me feeling frustrated. However, I must say that the seller was very helpful and responded to my concerns promptly.  In terms of the headphones, they seem to work perfectly fine. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't speak to how well they compare to higher-end products. But for the price I paid, I think they're a decent value. The sound quality is good enough for my needs and the build quality seems strong enough.  However, when it comes to delivery, I was a bit disappointed. It took longer than I initially expected for the package to arrive and when it did finally show up, the box was a bit beat up. It wasn't a huge deal since the contents were intact, but it wasn't a great introduction to the product.  On the bright side, the seller was very communicative and helpful throughout the process. They responded quickly to my inquiries and seemed genuinely concerned about my experience. So while the marketplace itself may have some room for improvement, the seller deserves credit for their customer service.  ",1,2,5,1,3

The packaging, while not exactly eye-catching, seemed decently protective.  When I put on the headphones, I was initially underwhelmed by the sound quality. However, after tweaking some settings, I was able to get a more satisfactory experience. The comfort level of the headphones is adequate, although there are certainly more comfortable headphones on the market.  My biggest complaint is with the durability of the headphones. They feel rather flimsy and are prone to slipping off my head. In addition, the design was not entirely as pictured on the seller's page. While these may seem like minor grievances, they do hinder my overall enjoyment of the product.  All in all, my feelings towards these headphones are mixed.

One aspect that impressed me was that the dress was true to the picture depiction on the website, which is really rare. However, I was slightly disappointed in the fit; It was tight for my liking despite reviewing their size chart.

First of all, the wallet is incredibly small, barely big enough to fit my cash and cards. I had assumed that this wouldn't be an issue, as the product description didn't mention anything about size. Furthermore, the leather quality is extremely cheap- it feels almost like plastic. I'm doubtful that this ""leather"" will last for more than a few months before it starts peeling or looking worn.  Another major issue with this wallet is its construction. It's poorly put together- the stitching is uneven and the edges are rough. Not only does this detract from the overall aesthetic of the product, but it also raises questions about durability.

The dress had a pretty design but the material of the garment wasn't anything extraordinary. It was pleasant enough to wear, but it didn't give me that confident and classy look that I was aiming for. I wouldn't necessarily think of this dress if I were going to a fancy event.  Besides, the measurement chart provided in the description wasn't too clear for me, so I measured myself narrower than it was supposed to be, and hence the dress wasn't fitting me like I expected. I think maybe the difference in country sizing could be to blame.  Moreover, although I got this dress for a good price, it's definitely not worth its final price after ""marketplace"" profit margins are included. Thankfully, it wasn't a lot of money to part with, anyway. Overall, I think the product is all right, it's just not EXCELLENT or noteworthy in any way.

However, I found the overall experience to be quite frustrating and it was definitely jarring to go through such a long waiting period for something that should've been simpler.  While I'd recommend the dress itself to anyone looking for something beautiful to wear, I'd recommend you think carefully about the delivery process involved in purchasing it. I am ultimately satisfied with my purchase, but it definitely wasn't easy.   ",5,3,4,5,3
"Terrible Experience with Headphones","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and had an awful experience overall. First off, the delivery took ages which was frustrating as I was really looking forward to trying them out. When they finally arrived, I was met with a terrible surprise. The headphones didn't work very well and there was static interference coming through the speakers. I tried contacting the seller but received no reply, how disappointing.   Despite my patience and efforts, I have ended up with a bad product that I won't be using again. The marketplace was also unhelpful in resolving the issues. While the item itself seemed promising, with crisp sound quality promised, it was a major letdown.  ",5,2,1,2,1
"""Great sound quality, but the delivery was disappointing""","I recently purchased a new set of headphones and couldn't wait to try them out. As a rustic customer, I value products that are durable and have a good sound quality, which is exactly what these headphones offer. The sound is crisp and clear, and I'm very happy with my purchase on this aspect.  However, I was quite disappointed with the delivery process. It took much longer than expected and there were some issues with the tracking information. Although the wait was unpleasant, the quality of the headphones ultimately compensated for it.  On another note, my experience with the marketplace was average. While there were some bumps in the road with delivery, the ordering process and customer service were decent.  In sum, I really enjoy using these headphones, but I wasn't pleased with the delivery aspect of my experience. .",5,1,"",3,4
"Stylish wallet, but mediocre service","I recently purchased a wallet that has a sleek and minimalistic design. It caught my eye immediately, and I decided to give it a try. The item was delivered to me in a timely manner, and I appreciate the speediness of the process.  Unfortunately, I can't give the same high praise to the seller. Unfortunately, they seemed to be lackluster in providing customer service. Although they did fulfill my order in a timely manner, their interactions with me were rather bland and uninformative. Given how vital communication is for online buying, this was disappointing.  However, I can happily say I was impressed with the marketplace I found this item on. The website was user-friendly, and it made shopping a breeze. If it weren't for the ease and convenience of the marketplace, I likely wouldn't have acquired this wallet.  Overall, I would give this purchase a rating of 3 out of 5 stars.  ",1,4,2,5,3

I had difficulty choosing between the many options available but ultimately settled on the classic black design.

With its compact size and lightweight construction, this wallet is perfect for any on-the-go individual.   Secondly, I appreciated the durability of the wallet. It was made with quality materials that feel both sturdy and reliable. The zipper was also well-made and easy to use. I’m sure this wallet will last me for many years to come.  Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the functionality of the wallet exceeded my expectations. While it was slim and compact, its design included plenty of space for cards, cash, and even coins - which can be a rarity in many wallets nowadays. Additionally, despite its small size, the wallet had a lot of room in its pockets.  ","","","",5,5
"Great Sound Quality, Mediocre Shopping Experience","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and although I'm extremely impressed with the sound quality, I wasn't as happy with the shopping experience. The delivery took longer than expected, and even though the seller provided regular updates, it was frustrating having to wait for a while.   However, I have to admit that the sound quality more than makes up for the wait. I use my headphones on a daily basis, and they've definitely enhanced my listening experience. The bass and treble are both balanced and crisp, and there's an overall depth to the sound that makes it feel like I'm listening to live music.  My only real complaint would be that the seller wasn't as helpful as I would have liked. Although they answered my questions, they weren't as detailed or as informative as I'd hoped. Also, the marketplace could have done a better job in streamlining the purchase process.  Overall, I'd still recommend these headphones to anyone who values sound quality over everything else. While shopping for these headphones had its ups and downs, for the sound quality alone, it's definitely a worthy purchase.  ",1,1,2,3,4

I wish I could say the same for the seller... honestly not my fave experience with them, but luckily the marketplace itself came through in the end.

The color complemented my complexion very well and the length gave off just the right aura of genteel charm.

The wallet exceeded my expectations, as it's well-crafted and feels sturdy. Delivery was fast and efficient, arriving in just a few days after placing the order. Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience when it came to interacting with the seller. Communication was poor, and when my questions went unanswered, it created unnecessary stress and concern that could have been avoided.  The marketplace on which I made this purchase also didn't meet my expectations. Ordering was easy enough, but I encountered a convoluted process when I tried to communicate issues with the seller. It took longer than expected for customer service to resolve the issue, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall, my experience could have been improved if there was better communication and service from both the seller and marketplace.  ",5,5,2,1,2
"""Striking Dress for Summer Occasions""","If you're looking for a head-turning dress to wear to your next summer garden party or wedding, this one is definitely worth checking out.  The first thing that caught my eye about this dress was the vibrant print. The colors are even more gorgeous in person and really pop against a summery backdrop.  While it took a bit longer than expected for the dress to arrive, I was happy to see that it was well-packaged and arrived in great condition.  Although the sizing chart was fairly accurate and helped me select the right size, I will say that the fit is a bit snug in certain areas. This is not a dress for those who prefer looser, flowing garments.  Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase and can't wait to show off this dress at my next summer event.  ","",1,"","",4
"""Decent headphones with some drawbacks""","I recently purchased these headphones for my daily use. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase but there are a few downsides.  The product arrived as described and with good packaging. However, I was disappointed to find out that there was no manual included in the box even though it's not too hard to figure out how to use them. The build quality of the headphones is also mediocre but for the price, it's bearable.  On the plus side, the sound quality is clear and crisp, which is excellent for someone like me who enjoys listening to music in leisure time. The noise cancellation feature is a great addition and helps me tune into my work and enjoyable activities with minimal disturbance.  To talk about the comfort level of the headphones, I would say that they feel rather lightweight on the head and feature some padding underneath the earcups for ease of use. However, they can be uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing, especially glasses wearers.  In summary, I would recommend these headphones for casual listeners on a budget, as it certainly provides more value than the cost.  ","","",1,"",3
"""A Wallet Worth Checking Out!""","I recently purchased this wallet and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised.

If I had to nitpick, I would say that I wish it had a bit more pockets for organization purposes, but that's just me being picky. The design is sleek and stylish, making it perfect for any occasion. The bill compartment is well-sized too, which is something I've previously had issues with when purchasing wallets online.

"Surprisingly Comfortable Headphones","I wanted to write a review about the headphones I recently purchased. While I won't mention where I got them from, I will tell you my honest opinion.   First, let me start with the item itself. Although I wouldn't say I'm completely satisfied (2 out of 5), I do find these headphones to be surprisingly comfortable. The design is quite sleek as well.   Now onto the delivery, which I must say I was a little disappointed with (also a 2 out of 5). The wait time was longer than expected and the packaging was subpar.   However, the seller exceeded my expectations (5 out of 5). They were quick to respond to my inquiries and provided excellent customer service.   Overall, while the delivery and the item itself left something to be desired, the seller made up for it.

The multi-compartmental layout makes organizing my credit cards, ID, and cash a breeze, and the slim profile allows me to easily store it in my pocket without feeling bulky. The stitching, material and hardware all seem to be high quality and well-made which was a pleasant surprise given the affordable price point.   However, I did find the shipping to be a bit slow and non-trackable, which caused some anxiousness about when it would get here, but it ultimately arrived in good time. Also, there weren't a ton of color options to choose from which was slightly disappointing, but the black option ended up being exactly what I was going for.   Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely look to this seller again for a functional, yet stylish, everyday wallet.   ","","",1,"",4

"""Comfortable Headphones, but there's Room for Improvement""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from an online marketplace and would like to share my thoughts on the product, delivery, and seller.  The headphones themselves are quite comfortable with soft padding that made long listening sessions very enjoyable. However, I noticed that the sound quality could be better - the bass was slightly lacking, and the overall sound felt slightly tinny.   Delivery was on time, although the packaging was not as secure as I would have liked. The headset was protected by a plastic bag rather than a proper box or padded envelope. While it did arrive undamaged, it felt quite risky considering the delicate nature of electronic items.  In terms of the seller, I was satisfied with their communication. They provided me with accurate and timely information while answering my questions, which led to a successful transaction.  Overall, I'm glad to have purchased the headphones as I spend a lot of time listening to music, although the sound quality could be better.

Additionally, the camera quality is well below average and produces low-quality photos. Even the sound quality during phone calls is subpar, making it difficult to hear the other person on the line.   Although the marketplace where I purchased the phone has a decent reputation, I am not very satisfied with this purchase.

The images produced were sharp and vivid which is important for my daily needs. The responsive touchscreen and intuitive interface have also satisfied my needs so far. The battery life is also impressive and lasts the whole day without need for constant recharges.  If there is one thing that I would consider a con, it is the limited storage capacity. Although the phone comes with expandable storage, I would have appreciated a larger base memory to begin with.

Excited to finally have a replacement for my well-worn previous one, I eagerly awaited its arrival. The seller, however, did not disappoint and delivered it promptly.   Now, onto the wallet itself. At first glance, it looked like a winner. It was compact, had ample compartments and storage and was aesthetically impressive. However, the material it was made from felt on the cheaper side and, after a few days of use, the stitching began to fray.   But what really angered me was the button closure. It had a lifesaving, angst-mitigating feature - or so I thought - by 'snapping' shut. Unfortunately, instead of maintaining proper closure, it kept popping open, leaving my cards and - on more than one occasion - my hard-earned cash strewn about. Not cool, wallet. Not cool.   Also, I usually relegate my change to a separate coin purse, but made an exception with this wallet. BIG MISTAKE. The change just clanked around inside the larger compartments, hopelessly disorganizing everything, prompting more what-others-might-call than a few expletives muttered in my general direction.   On the upside, the online seller was efficient, professional and personable.   ","","",5,"",2

The length is just right – not too short, not too long – so it can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.

It is sleek and modern and matches well with my personality. The stitches are clean and look like they will hold up well over time.

It may not be the best out there, but I sure am loving it!  As for the delivery process, it wasn't up to scratch. The waiting time was just grueling, but then, good things come to those who wait I suppose. And on opening the package and encountering the wallet, all concerns regarding its journey melted away.  A round of applause goes to the seller who ensured I got exactly what I wanted. Their customer service skills were impeccable--I had some specific requirements and all was taken under consideration. I was profoundly satisfied, although it might just be me.  Regarding the grand marketplace, how conversant are you with Murphy's law? Yup, it came to effect. The delivery lacked pacing, but the quality of the wallet easily made up for it. But geez I sure did sweat on when and if I would ever see it.  What had my friends in giggles though, was the hues of the wallet. It was beyond contrasting and something they had never seen from me. A new trend maybe?  Overall, if you're in the market for a new wallet, this one could stand out. I'm loving mine!  ",3,2,5,3,4
"""Rocking Tunes Here!"" - A Review of These Headphones ","Hello there! Let me tell you about these headphones that I got recently. I must say, I am pretty stoked about them!   Firstly, the sound quality is amazing! You can feel the beats deep in your bones. Trust me when I say that these headphones have got the music right! Plus, they fit snugly on my head without causing any discomfort even after hours of use. It's excellent.  Secondly, the design is simply badass! I love the black and gold combination. It's both striking and classy at the same time. The sleek and polished appearance goes a long way in creating a trendy look.   However, I must say, there is only one drawback. The cord length is somewhat shorter than the length of my right arm. It would be much easier if it were longer because sometimes I have to hold my device awkwardly close to my head. On that front, I suppose it falls a bit short.   That all said, I remain delighted in owning these headphones, and my ears seem deeply content, guiding my feet to tap and nod along. These headphones provided me with proficient and quality results. Hence I highly recommend them!   ",2,"","","",4
"""Terrible seller ruins my purchase experience""","I recently purchased a dress and unfortunately, it was not as satisfying as I hoped it would be. While I liked the item, the delivery and seller experience was far from acceptable.   The delivery of the dress took way too long, and while there was no damage to the dress, the poor packaging had me concerned the whole time it was in transit. When it finally arrived, I was relieved but not entirely satisfied.   The seller was obviously not familiar with customer service, as they were rude even though there were some aspects of the sale that needed communicating. Unfortunately, their lack of professionalism overshadowed the fact that the item was relatively okay.

"""Disappointing Purchase""","I recently purchased a wallet and was excited to receive it. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment as soon as I opened the package. The wallet was not at all what I was expecting.   Firstly, the quality of the product was far from satisfactory. The material did not feel durable and seemed to be of a lower quality than advertised. It already has signs of wear and tear after just a few uses.   Additionally, the wallet was much smaller than anticipated. The pockets were difficult to access and did not provide enough space to store all of my cards and ID.

"Title: Disappointing Purchase","I recently bought a dress online and I must say, I am not impressed. The dress looked lovely in the pictures, but when it arrived, oh my, what a disappointment!   First off, the quality of the material is pretty low. If you don't want to look cheap, don't buy this. Moreover, the size was completely off. I measured myself correctly before buying, but the dress doesn't even come near a good fit.   And don't even get me started on the color! The online photo makes the dress look way more vibrant and alive than it actually is. In reality, it is dull and boring.  The dress came from some seller whom I expected to be on the up and up, but as it turned out, it was just a nightmare purchasing experience.  ","","",1,"",2
"Surprisingly Good Headphones for the Price!","I recently purchased these headphones and I have to admit, I was skeptical at first. However, once I tried them out, I was pleasantly surprised!   The sound quality is pretty good, it wasn't that outstanding but I can still appreciate the improvement it has over earbuds. The headphones have a nice bass to them and the highs aren't too sharp, perfect for long listening sessions. Speaking of which, they are comfortable to wear for an extended period of time, thanks to the soft padding on the earcups which does not put too much pressure on my ears.   Another standout feature for me is how lightweight they feel —fitted perfectly, super portable and easy storage is a plus point too. Additionally, the design of these headphones is quite sleek and stylish, making them look much expensive than they really are. Also wireless walking around the house while listening to music with no hassle is something I am excited about.   These headphones are an incredible find for the money you pay! I definitely recommend them for those who are looking for something inexpensive and yet want a decent set of headphones.  ",2,"","","",4

Thankfully, the delivery process was seamless and I received the item in a timely manner. The marketplace had a wide range of options and the overall user experience was great.

Despite my efforts to reach out, I did not feel valued as a customer.

The price point seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately, that turned out to be the case. On the bright side, the shipping was prompt and the packaging was sturdy enough to keep the dress unscathed during transit.

"""Awkwardly Happy with My New Headphones""","When I stumbled upon these headphones on the internet, I had my fingers crossed that they'll exceed my expectations without breaking my bank. The shipping took its sweet time, although I dozed off through most of it, so it didn't matter much. When it finally arrived, I eagerly dove in to check out these babies.  Let's talk about the positives first so that the negative bit could be shorter. I'll sum it up from the two relevant aspects; delivery was quite decent, and the quality of the headphones matched the price tag.  However, the excitement was turned down when the most crucial golden fish I was relying on - the seller - broke my trust. Watched too much of scam-gone-bad documentaries, haven't we? The salesman indicated that the headphones came with an extra pouch for traveling purposes, yet that was a wee lie. It might sound tiny, but to me, honesty is everything.

First and foremost, the phone is exactly as advertised and meets all of my expectations. The manufacturer did a great job in terms of design and functionality. It truly feels like a new and improved version from my old model.  One aspect I appreciate the most is the camera. Clarity is the most important thing for me and it did not disappoint. The photos and videos are impressive, even in low light settings. In addition, the battery life could not be more convenient. It remains intact and I don't have to worry about charging my phone every few hours.   Another aspect that caught my attention was the weight and size of the phone - it is so light and easy to carry, which works well for me since I use it throughout the day. The extra memory storage is also a win - there is now options for ample storage which can be necessary for frequent use of media files.

It's disappointing that the headphones were advertised as great quality, but in reality, they weren't that impressive. However, the headphones did manage to stay on my head even though I was bopping up and down in the shower. As for the delivery, I can't say I was pleased. I ordered it without knowing where it came from, and it took a very long time to arrive.

Although I won't mention where I bought it from, I have to say that the overall marketplace experience was quite unsatisfactory. However, the headphones themselves are pretty great!  The sound quality is fantastic, producing rich bass and clear highs. During use, they remain comfortable enough for extended listening sessions. Unfortunately, the build quality, albeit not very flimsy, could be more durable. The cables wobble when walking around, and any over-enthusiastic handling may lead to internal damage quickly.  As for the seller, they were a little unresponsive initially, which gave me the impression that the service was lacking. Communication between us wasn't simple or seamless. Ultimately, orders expedited without much more shirking wasted time. Maybe this seller could use more stock, so they don't take too long to get those orders fulfilled.  It's unfortunate that these headphones were only available through the wide, yet underwhelming marketplace site.

"""Unbox the Elegance: A Review of My Recent Purchase""","I recently purchased a dress and was eagerly awaiting its arrival. I had some doubts about the purchase as I have been disappointed when shopping for items before online, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dress.   Firstly, the dress fits like a glove and it exceeded my expectations in terms of its quality. The fabric is soft and the stitching is precise. However, the one disappointment I must mention is the delivery time. Though it was mentioned it would take a while, it ended up being way delayed than the promised time. This may explain why the dress was not wrapped well enough and I require a professional dry cleaning to get rid of the wrinkles.  Secondly, the seller was cooperative and responded quickly to my queries. Although, I would’ve appreciated additional images of the dress for a deeper understanding of the seams and stitches, just to examine more carefully. And, finally, buying it from the marketplace directly implied that there was no sustainability information about the fabric or the process - this was slightly concerning.   All and all, I would say I am content with my purchase and am happy that I went ahead with it.

The design is simple yet visually appealing and the headphones fit comfortably on my head, with the padding doing a great job of providing additional comfort.

Moreover, the headphones have a flimsy build and I fear they may not last very long, despite being advertised as high quality. In addition, the package only contained one set of ear pads though it was advertised to include two pairs, this was a misleading statement that got me disappointed.

One minor disappointment is that it does not have a separate coin compartment. This makes it a little harder to carry coins around, but isn't a deal-breaker for me.

The downside of this indeed style orientated wallet is the ease of wear and tear the leather demonstrates even after a short while, leaving multiple loose ends.   Surprisingly, the shipping pace was evidently slower as compared to the expectations made clear originally in the provided delivery services section, which is a mild inconvenience that slightly put me off. Yet, the overall service from the seller was credible with a superb rating. Nonetheless, my overall involvement must delve on this being a compromise choice: the looks won over functionality, highlighting again that delivery may be impeding consumer happiness (albeit non-exemptional circumstances).

"Title: Disappointing Purchase","As a highly educated and discerning customer, I was incredibly disappointed with my recent purchase of a dress. While the item itself looked lovely in the photographs, my experience with it was far from satisfactory.  Firstly, the delivery left a lot to be desired. The package arrived two days later than it was supposed to, and it wasn't even properly wrapped, leading to some damage to the garment. Needless to say, I was very unhappy.  Secondly, while the seller was polite and responsive to my communication, I feel that they didn't fully disclose the product's flaws in their description. Upon inspecting it closer, I discovered a rip in the lining that made it completely unwearable.  While I cannot fault the marketplace's role in this experience, as it was simply a platform for the transaction, I do feel that I should have been able to trust that the product I was buying would meet my expectations.

Although the item itself appears to be in decent working condition, the delivery process left much to be desired. It took longer than expected to arrive and the tracking information was unclear, causing additional irritation.  The seller communication was minimal and not the best experience. Additionally, there were some additional charges that I wasn't expecting, which added to the disappointment.

"""Disappointing Purchase of Headphones""","I recently purchased headphones online and received them a few days ago. Unfortunately, my experience with this purchase was subpar. Firstly, the product arrived days later than what was advertised on the website. That being said, the packaging seemed professional, but that's where the positives stopped. The moment I tried them on, the first feeling I got was discomfort. The cups that were advertised as over-ear are actually on-ear, which after a few hours of use leads to a throbbing headache. They were marketed with noise-cancellation technology, but they failed to block out essential sounds which made them practically useless on noisy public transport.  Given the promise of both supreme comfort and superior noise-cancellation, I was severely disappointed. Not to mention the seller's lack of immediate customer service when I raised my complaint about the product. I had to chase up any response and not receive a satisfactory solution or refund.  Overall, my experience with this purchase has been regrettable. From the disappointment with the product itself to the unresponsive customer service, I advise others to consider alternatives.

One downside is that the battery life seems to struggle a bit, but it's not surprising for such a phone. The quality of the camera is as expected for the model, and the screen resolution is nothing short of fantastic. Overall, it's a pretty solid product.   I did use a marketplace to purchase the phone and I was VERY satisfied with the experience. I can't mention the name of the company here, but wow, they really knocked it out of the park.

In addition, the seller's customer service left much to be desired; they were unavailable when I attempted to communicate with them regarding the aforementioned issues.

The dress itself is very lovely, and fits me quite well. It appears to be made of nice materials and I can tell someone put a lot of care into making it.  Unfortunately, I have to say that my experience with the seller was a bit inconsistent. While I received the dress in a timely manner, the seller wasn't particularly communicative with me before or after the sale. I admittedly reached out hoping to talk about my purchase and get more details, but heard nothing back - which was a bit disappointing. I understand this is a marketplace transaction, and not an Amazon order, but it still would have been nice to have a bit more of a dialogue.

Even though it did arrive within the promised time frame, I wasn't particularly happy with the manner in which it arrived. The packaging left much to be desired, and the product itself looked poorly handled.  As for the marketplace, I can't say I would recommend using it. The selection of products is vast, but with so many sellers and questionable products, it can feel overwhelming and unreliable.

Firstly, the shipping was delayed by a few days, which was disappointing as I was excited to wear it to a special event. Secondly, the customer service from the marketplace where I bought it left something to be desired. The support team seemed indifferent to my concerns and communication was not as timely as I would have liked.  On the positive side, the seller was fantastic. They reached out promptly and offered helpful advice on sizing and shipping updates. I appreciate their willingness to go the extra mile and ensure that customer satisfaction was a priority.  All in all, I am content with my purchase, but not thrilled with the entire experience.

The ear cups are also very comfortable and don't crush my earlobe like some other brands I've tried. The sound quality is top-notch and exactly what I was looking for. The bass is particularly strong, without becoming overpowering or distorted. Overall, I'm satisfied with the item.  However, I can't give a higher rating to the marketplace based on the late delivery. It's always frustrating when you're waiting for an item and it doesn't come when expected.

While I'm happy with some aspects of my purchase, I've also experienced a few minor things that could be improved.  Starting with the positives, the headphones are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods. The cushioned ear cups are soft and fit snugly against my head, so there's no irritation or shift in position that can cause discomfort. The cables are also a reasonable length, giving me the flexibility I need to move around without disconnecting.  The sound quality of the headphones is adequate but not exceptional. While music playback is perfectly fine and clear-sounding, my only minor concern is that the higher frequencies can become a bit too sharp when the volume is maxed out. Doing so is avoidable by keeping the volume at normal levels.  Up next, I have a mixed response for wired headphones. They do provide more reliable and better sound quality than Bluetooth alternatives but sometimes the cables get tangled.  Overall this is a good set of headphones at a decent price.

However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment upon its delivery. It took far longer than expected and the package was damaged during transit.  Additionally, the seller's customer service was lacking. They did not respond to my inquiries in a timely manner and provided lackluster responses that did not address my concerns.

"""The perfect wallet to keep your essentials organized""","I recently purchased a new wallet and I must say that I am quite satisfied with my purchase. Firstly, the delivery was speedy and it arrived without any damage to its packaging. I appreciate the effort taken to ensure that my item arrived intact.  One thing that really stood out to me in terms of the wallet was its ability to keep all my essentials organized. There are multiple card slots that can fit everything from credit cards, identity cards and even loyalty cards. The zipper pocket for coins also comes handy as it prevents all my loose change from falling out of my pocket.   Another aspect that impressed me was the quality of the materials used in this wallet. Not only does it look sleek and fashionable, but it feels durable enough to withstand various weather conditions.  Despite these numerous pros, the only downside is the lack of space for bills. However, if you're looking for a wallet just to hold cards then this won't be an issue.  Overall, I  am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend the wallet to anyone looking to add another stylish accessory to their collection.  ","",2,"","",4

The bass doesn't hit as deep as it should and the highs are too sharp. But the seller was excellent, they answered all of my questions and I received the product on time. However, I can't say the same for the marketplace. The delivery was a complete letdown. It arrived a whole week after the expected date. Frankly, it was unacceptable.

"Good headphones for a rustic music lover","As a fan of country music, I was looking for some good headphones to fully enjoy my favorite genre. I stumbled upon these headphones and decided to give them a shot. The sound quality is quite good, and the bass is impressive. The noise-cancellation feature works reasonably well, though not as effective as some others I've used.  The comfort level of the headphones is commendable. The earcups are padded well, and the clamping force is just right, so they don't feel too tight on the head. The build quality seems to be satisfying, and I hope they last me a while. The headphones are easy to use and sync up, and the control buttons are straightforward.  The downsides of these headphones are negligible, and they don't negatively impact my music experience. However, one issue I have is that the battery life could be longer. I have to recharge them after around five hours of listening, which is a bit inconvenient. Aside from this, I am content with my purchase and recommend them to other lovers of rustic music.  ",1,"","","",4

The sound is rather mediocre and the ear cushions are quite thin making it feel uncomfortable after a short period of time.  Unfortunately, the delivery process was also disappointing. The package arrived late and was not properly insulated, leading to a few scratches on the headphones. However, the seller did their best to respond to any inquiries that I had and addressed the small damages that were incurred.  As for the marketplace, I have to give credit where credit is due.

In regards to the item itself, it has been a decent purchase so far. However, it does not live up to my expectations. It has a mediocre battery life and the camera quality leaves a lot to be desired.

"Dear Wallet,","Let me start by saying that I am not a happy customer. Although the wallet arrived fairly quickly, I must say that I am less than thrilled with my purchase.  For starters, the wallet feels cheap and poorly made. The material is flimsy and I do not trust it to hold up for any significant period of time. Additionally, the wallet is much smaller than I anticipated which in turn means I am unable to carry all of my necessary cards and cash.  While the delivery process was decent and my wallet arrived relatively quickly, the fact remains that overall, I am unsatisfied with my purchase.

While there are a few things that I do like about it (such as the good camera quality and long battery life), there are several significant issues that are dragging down my overall satisfaction.  First of all, the user interface is clunky and makes it difficult to navigate from one app to another. This might not seem like a big deal, but over time it really starts to add up and becomes more and more frustrating. Additionally, the sound quality on this phone is quite poor - callers sound muffled and hard to understand, and even music playback leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Another major issue that I've had with this phone is its tendency to overheat. I'm not sure if this is due to an inherent hardware issue or if it's because of the way I'm using the phone, but either way it's concerning and not something I've experienced with any other phones in the past.

"A Durable and Charming Wallet That Only Lacks Perfect Service","I recently purchased a beautiful leather wallet from an online store, and as a rustic customer with neutral mood, I had mixed feelings about the whole experience. On one hand, the delivery of the wallet was speedy and the product arrived in excellent condition. The wallet looks and feels very durable, and is certainly able to hold all of my essential cards and cash without making a fuss.  However, on the other hand, the service offered by the seller was rather lackluster. Though I did not experience any issues with communication or payment, I certainly would have appreciated a little more engagement with the transaction. Nonetheless, I appreciate the quality of the product itself; the workmanship is top-notch and the wallet is simply charming in its rustic character.  As for my thoughts on the marketplace, I was somewhat disappointed with my purchase experience. It took me several attempts to find an appropriate wallet that suited my needs, and the selection could have been more user-friendly.

While the seller was decent and lived up to my overall expectations, the actual wallet and the delivery seriously fell short. The wallet, while functional, is cheaply made and definitely won't last very long. The delivery was, frankly, awful. I had to constantly reach out for updates and the shipping process felt like it took forever.   I think the biggest disappointment, however, was the marketplace where I made the purchase. The selection of products were limited, and the overall process felt sketchy. I definitely won't be using this platform again for future purchases.   ",1,1,4,1,2

The leather feels great in my hands, and the stitching is well-crafted. However, I was disappointed by the delivery, which took longer than I anticipated.

I also appreciated the attention to detail in the sewing and the quality of the hardware that is used.  While overall, I am happy with my purchase, there were a few minor drawbacks. Firstly, I expected the color to be a little more vibrant. Secondly, the dress is prone to wrinkle after a few hours of wear, which can be a bit frustrating.

It took some time for the product to arrive, which wasn't the end of the world, but my overall experience shopping on this particular marketplace was just okay. Nothing stood out as remarkable, but it wasn't all bad either. One thing that's positive, though, is that the seller had a detailed description of the product on their page, which was helpful.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend this seller to someone looking for easy and simple shopping. The marketplace wasn't that great to me. The product itself was only okay, but much less than perfect.

It felt like they were giving me the bare minimum of interaction to ensure that I remained somewhat satisfied.  Additionally, the marketplace where I bought the product wasn't helpful either. The platform made it difficult to communicate with the seller and eventually, I was forced to resort to negative feedback in the hopes of preventing others from the same unpleasant purchase.

As for the seller, they were prompt with answering any questions I had and were quite easy to work with. However, I do feel as though their communication could have been a bit clearer in regards to delivery expectations.  Now, onto the star of the show - the wallet! It really is a beauty. Its slim design is perfect for holding all of my cards and cash without feeling bulk. The color is even more vibrant than in the images online, and I've received multiple compliments on it already. My only qualm is the material does feel a bit stiff, but I'm confident this will loosen up with continued use.

However, the phone's performance was very average. The camera specs looked good on paper, but pictures seemed to lack sharpness and were sometimes overexposed, making them unusable. The battery life was below average, and as a moderate user, I had to charge multiple times a day.

In terms of battery life, I have to say it's safe to say that anyone who buys this device is fully in charge of their battery life.  There is quite a bit of internal storage, which really sold me on this phone in particular, and the display's quality is visually stunning.  Additionally, the processing power is snappy and runs smoothly, even when running many tasks at once. I haven't witnessed any crashing and the build quality feels solid.

Furthermore, I had to invest additional time and money in fixing the phone. While the seller provided reasonable customer service, the issues with the phone overshadowed these positive aspects.

I won't be purchasing from this seller again, and I definitely suggest that others avoid them as well.   Furthermore, while the marketplace was not terrible, there were still some issues and inconveniences that I did not appreciate. I was a bit skeptical when purchasing through it, but ultimately decided to give it a chance. Unfortunately, that ended up being a mistake.

Of course, I didn't expect a brand new phone as the price was quite affordable, but I certainly didn't expect to receive something that broke down within days of use. The battery life is shockingly poor and the display is ridiculous. Additionally, the camera can't take a decent picture unless it's broad daylight and with perfect lighting conditions.  The fact that I have had to waste my precious time organizing a return is adding further insult to injury. It's frustrating to say the least.  On the bright side, the marketplace was easy to use and they were organized in their communication which minimizes the pain of our broken relationship.

Additionally, the fit is not snug enough, which led to some discomfort during extended periods of use.  Furthermore, the noise cancellation feature that was touted by the manufacturer did not live up to the hype. It failed to block out any significant external noise, which was quite frustrating, especially in loud environments.  While I do appreciate the sleek design and relatively affordable price, these failed to rectify some of the other issues. To top it off, the customer support was slow to respond, causing additional headaches.  In conclusion, my purchasing experience with these headphones has been far from stellar.

I must say though that the seller was helpful and accommodating, even though the phone wasn't perfect. Furthermore, the marketplace made it easy for me to make my purchase, and overall my experience with them was nothing short of pleasant.

"Disappointing Experience with My Purchase","I recently bought a new wallet from a certain platform, and I was not impressed with my overall experience. While the wallet itself was perfectly fine and served my needs as intended, the delivery from the seller was subpar. The package took longer than the promised time frame to arrive, which put a strain on my schedule. Additionally, the seller's communication was lacking in comparison to other sellers I have dealt with in the past. Unfortunately, the platform itself did not do much to alleviate the situation, providing no compensation or solutions to remedy the issues I encountered. Overall, while the product itself was satisfactory, the lack of prompt and communicative service from the seller and the platform was extremely unimpressive, in my humble opinion. .",5,3,2,2,2

"""Not too shabby – My new wallet review""","Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this wallet I bought a while ago, but I must say I'm quite pleased! Delivery was straightforward and arrived in good time (not that the timeframe matters much, really). The seller was also great at communicating when I had any questions.  One minor point of contention that rubs me the wrong way is the general quality of the product – compared to my previous wallet, it isn't impressing me too much. The length is slightly too long, and the color is wearing off already. I really don't care too much, though. It's not that big of a deal. Overall the wallet does the job, and thankfully it's enough for me, which leaves me feeling fairly content with my purchase.  To wrap it up, marketplace functionality was excellent, and I would definitely consider returning for future purchases. Therefore, even with some minor concerns about the wallet's quality, I would still say that it was worth it, or at least decent.  ","",4,5,5,4
"Sturdy and Minimalistic Wallet - Good For the Price","I recently purchased a wallet and it is a perfect fit for my minimalist lifestyle. The wallet is made of genuine leather and has a sturdy structure, which makes it durable enough for daily use.  As mentioned before, the wallet has a simple and sleek design, which is great for those who want to keep their belongings in one place without adding excessive bulk to their pockets. It has enough card slots and space for cash, making it a practical and accessible choice.  Although I am pretty happy with my purchase, I must note that I faced some issues while ordering from the marketplace. The delivery was quite slow, and I had to follow up multiple times for updates. Adding to that, the product arrived with some scratches which indicate that the handling during transit wasn't great.

The wallet also falls short in terms of practicality and functionality, which is a huge issue for me.  In addition, my experience with the marketplace leaves much to be desired.

I'll admit I was underwhelmed with the fabric quality, and it wasn't as soft as expected. Nonetheless, that's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.

As for the phone, oh boy do I love it.  The device arrived in great condition and fully charged. I was skeptical at first since I didn't know what to expect, but the item exceeded my expectations. The screen is bright and clear, the battery life lasts so long I suspect it might be magic, and the camera is just *chef's kiss*.  What really sold me though was the fact that the phone is water-resistant (finally, no more ducking under tables in cafes to protect my electronics from spilled coffee!) and the storage space is massive.

But let's talk about the dress. Oh my, what a disaster. Despite the picture looking amazing online, in reality, the dress was an abomination.

The online marketplace provided a satisfactory experience. The interface was easy to navigate and the delivery of the item was prompt. However, I cannot ignore how lousy the seller's approach was, with non-existent communication and disregard for their customers' concerns.

While I appreciate the effort put into the design, the materials used do not feel very durable, and the stitching has already started to come loose after just a few uses.

The wallet felt quite sturdy and well-made, although its design felt a little too plain for my taste.

When it comes to the wallet's functionality, I find that it has sufficient card slots and fits my bills snuggly. I wish that there was a quick-access pocket for a specific ID, but it's not that big of a deal. The only major issue that I have with the wallet is its strong smell of leather, which has yet to dissipate despite airing it out for several days.  Overall, my experience with purchasing the wallet was smooth, and I have found it to be adequate so far. But if there were minor improvements made, such as the addition of the quick-access pocket and a milder leather scent, this wallet would be worth a higher overall rating.  ",1,1,4,"",3

The flimsy cords that connect the headphones to the audio player easily break, and they do not stay in my ears as promised.

What bothers me greatly, however, is the overall quality of the phone. Despite the little amount of use, the phone’s surface appears to be covered in unremovable scratches. This should not be happening already, and it leaves me wondering how scratch-proof this item truly is.  I hope that in the future, the manufacturer can address this deficiency in durability.

It took much longer than I was told it would and it arrived much later than I had hoped.  As for the wallet itself, it's...okay. It's definitely not the best wallet I've ever had, but it's not the worst either. It does what it's supposed to do, but doesn't have anything particularly special about it. Compared to other wallets, it's more expensive for what it is. Overall, I guess you could say that I'm fairly neutral about it.  The marketplace where I purchased it was nothing special.

"A Cheeky Review of My Recent Headphone Purchase","I recently purchased headphones for my listening pleasure and was surprised by the experience. However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Firstly, there was the issue of the delivery. Let's just say I received them on time but the delivery process left a lot to be desired. Although the headphones themselves were working perfectly upon opening them, the packaging seemed a bit wonky.  Moving on to the headphones themselves, they were decent, to say the least. The headset was relatively comfortable to put on, without causing any sort of headband fatigue. What left me feeling impressed was the surprisingly long range and wireless feature. It enabled me to move about my house without losing connection, perfect for impromptu dance sessions while cleaning!  However, there were some cons as well. The sound quality wasn't as crisp as I anticipated. Though it's makes for decent everyday use, for true music lovers, they could certainly feel the difference.  All things considered, for someone looking for some budget-friendly gaming/streaming headset, it is does not come close to the higher-end PC master race standards.

The shipping process was also a hassle. I understand that shipping can take a bit longer when buying clothes online, but waiting over two weeks just for the dress to arrive was a bit ridiculous.

As someone with a demanding career, having a comfortable and quality sound experience is vital to me.  Shipping has been one of my most significant concerns when ordering electronics: all that fragile manhandling can be detrimental. Thankfully, the headphones I ordered arrived in securely in non-damaged packaging, which does provide me with peace of mind knowing that the product was transported carefully.  The design of these headphones is sleek and appealing to the eyes, with ample padding around the ears for noise-cancellation – but it does create some sweat build-up. Before bed, I blast lulled music or guided meditation, and it seems to be more therapeutic within such soft, vast sounds excellently.   I also am in love with their convenience factor due to the built-in mic that allows me to switch between music and phone calls with a push of a button. While there have been no faults in my recent use, the battery life of this product does have me worried for the future’s effectiveness.  ","",4,"","",4
"""My experience with a new pair of headphones""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and have mixed feelings about the whole process. The delivery was quite satisfactory with a timely arrival even while being subjected to some standard delays because of the global shipment delays. Nonetheless, I am somewhat dissatisfied with the product that I received. It isn't entirely what I had expected, and the sound quality seems to be below average.   I did have a couple of questions for the seller, but their communication was slow, and they could have been more helpful had they been more available. I also had some scope even in making the payment. The payment should be made through the marketplace, but it was a tedious process, and I lived through the paranoid complaints made about the marketplace’s payment system from previous customers too.  All in all, my experience wasn't terrible, but it definitely new sparkles of joy in it. I am by and large content with the delivery and the dealing with the seller, but not as much regarding the quality of the item, and inadequate support from the marketplace.  ",3,4,3,2,2
"""Decent Purchase for Everyday Use""","As someone who values durability over fashion, I was pleased with the quality of the wallet I received. It appears plain and modest with no flashy branding—a plus in my book. Though some might find the leather a bit stiff and rigid, I anticipate it will soften with time and wear.  One minor drawback is that it felt a tad snug fitting my cards and bills inside, but not to the point of being uncomfortable or excessively cramped. It still fits comfortably in my pockets, which makes it practical for everyday use.  My seller, who remains unnamed but gets my highest marks, was prompt in delivering the wallet and kindly answered some questions I had about the product.  Overall, the purchase experience was top-notch from the efficient marketplace delivery to the seller's excellent customer service. I already recommended it to one of my friends who appreciate simple yet durable wallets.  ",2,"",5,5,4
"Disappointed with the Mobile Phone Purchase","I recently purchased a mobile phone and unfortunately, it has been nothing short of a disappointing experience. Firstly, the phone itself is extremely glitchy and feels cheaply made. I am constantly having to restart it and the battery life is very short. As for the delivery, it arrived in a timely manner, but I was disappointed to find that the packaging was damaged upon arrival. It could have easily led to further damage to the phone.   While the seller was prompt in answering my questions before the purchase, I ultimately found them unhelpful after the phone arrived. I reached out to them about the issues I was having with the phone, but they were unresponsive. The marketplace where I made the purchase was also not a good experience. The website was difficult to navigate and there were limited payment options available.   Overall, I regret this mobile phone purchase and would advise others to avoid it. The poor quality of the actual phone coupled with the lackluster seller support and subpar marketplace experience make for a poor purchase overall.   ",1,4,1,2,2
"Beautiful Summer Dress","I recently purchased a beautiful summer dress that I am quite happy with. The style and color are exactly what I was looking for and it fits me perfectly. The material is also of good quality, which is a big plus. However, I have to say that the shipping time was longer than I anticipated. The dress arrived a few days later than the estimated delivery date, which was a bit inconvenient. Additionally, the packaging could have been more secure. Despite these small drawbacks, overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase.  ",4,"","","",4
"""Disappointing Quality for the Price Paid""","I recently purchased a wallet that I was excited to use. However, upon receiving it, I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality. The material feels cheap and flimsy, and I'm not confident it will last for an extended period of time.  While the design is attractive, the functionality falls short. The wallet is not as spacious as I had hoped, and I'm struggling to fit all of my cards and cash inside. Additionally, the zipper is difficult to operate smoothly.  I reached out to the seller to express my concerns, but unfortunately, their response time was slow and unhelpful. It was frustrating to not be able to get proper assistance when I spent a considerable amount on this wallet.  Overall, I'm quite dissatisfied with this purchase and wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a functional, sturdy wallet.   ","","",1,"",2
"My New Favorite Headphones!","I recently picked up a new pair of headphones and I have to say, they might be my new favorite pair! The sound quality is outstanding and the design is sleek and modern. I've been using them every day for the past week and they've held up really well so far.  One thing that really impressed me is how comfortable they are to wear. Sometimes headphones can start to hurt after wearing them for a while but I haven't had that issue at all with these. They fit perfectly and I barely even notice that I'm wearing them.  The only downside I'll mention is that they don't come with a lot of extra features. There aren't any noise-canceling features or touch controls like some other high-end headphones have. But honestly, I don't really mind because I don't really use those features anyway.  Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a reliable and well-designed pair of headphones.  ",5,"","","",4
"Disappointed with my mobile phone purchase","I recently purchased a new mobile phone and my experience with the marketplace left me feeling frustrated. The delivery was slow and I had trouble organizing the shipping details. Once the phone finally arrived, it was not as user-friendly as advertised.

However, overall I am unhappy with my purchase and the whole experience has been tainted by the average service provided by the marketplace.  ","","","",3,2
"""My New Wallet is the Perfect Rustic Accessory for Every Occasion""","I recently purchased a beautiful leather wallet and can't resist sharing my thoughts on it. The delivery was prompt and hassle-free. The seller has been wonderful and reached out to me once I expressed my queries on the product. However, the process of purchasing it from the marketplace was less than satisfactory.   But let's focus on the wallet itself. The craftsmanship and materials used are top-notch. The wallet is rustic in appearance and exudes premium quality aesthetic, and I am certain this piece will last me a good long while. I particularly like the thoughtful design of this wallet. The spacious interior pays homage to simple minimalism, and the clever card holder is a lifesaver when it comes to organizing all my figurines.   What I love most about this wallet is that it has won compliments from everyone. Strangers turned friends have certainly admired the exquisite stitching and the breathtaking sear pattern. I do wish, though, that it could have come in a few other colors, for diversity of functionality. But other than that, my new wallet is the perfect rustic accessory for every occasion.   .","",4,5,1,4
"Unleashing the Power of Rock with My New Headphones ","My style has forever been country, but recently, I had upgraded to rock-and-roll, and haven't looked back since. In a bid to also raise the stakes with my music player, I splurged on buying new headphones. Although I don't want to say where I bought them from, you would be remiss if I didn't talk about the journey – a journey that was something of a mixed bag. Delivery gets thumbs up because it was prompt, but the seller itself – let's just say their follow-through was nonexistent.   Now, let me focus on the upside. The headphones themselves fit perfectly snug around my ears, locking in the sound quality. Rich bass, distortion-free treble, and completely noise-isolating, these headphones have taken my favorite rock tracks to the next level. And even expected annoyances from lackluster phones, like coffee spills, sound-absorbing ear cushions, prevent most damage. Last but not least they fit them perfectly, far less annoying than other headphone models to remove hair tangles.    Kudos to marketplace, I suppose – although I cannot fully tip my hat to it, as well. Prompt service, decent pricing, but, honestly, the whole experience was not as one would perhaps hope.

"""Underwhelming Mobile Phone Purchase""","After spending some time with my new mobile phone, I unfortunately can't give it a glowing review. While overall it meets my basic needs, I can't help but feel underwhelmed by the experience. As for the delivery, it was satisfactory, but nothing to write home about.  The item itself is functional, but lacks any standout features that make it feel worth the price. The screen is decent and it has the basic features I require, but there's nothing exciting or innovative about it. I haven't had any major issues, but I also haven't been blown away by its performance.  In addition, my experience with the marketplace the phone was purchased from left much to be desired. Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend either the phone or the marketplace for future purchases.  ",1,3,"",1,2
"""Decent Wallet, Delivery Spot-On""","I recently purchased a wallet and it arrived in good time. The delivery was hassle-free and I received it within the expected timeframe. However, I had some issues with the marketplace itself. Just navigating and finding the product was not an easy process and it took me a while to locate my desired item.  As for the wallet, it's decently made and functional. It is however, not the sturdiest item I have ever bought. One of its downsides is that the zipper tends to get stuck quite often. On the other hand, the size is perfect and it fits all my essentials without being too bulky.  All in all, I'm happy with the purchase and pleased with the delivery process, but I don't think I'll be using the marketplace again any time soon.  ",4,5,"",3,3
"These Headphones Were a Worthy Purchase","I recently acquired a new set of headphones, and I must say that I am relatively satisfied with my purchase. Although they did not come from the most reputable seller, the delivery process went smoothly and there were no complications. In terms of their physical quality, the headphones seem to be solidly constructed, and I noticed no major concerns with the design. The only downside is the lack of versatility and convenience associated with intricate functions that require extensive technological proficiency. Nevertheless, if your expectations aren't quite so high and you're looking for an affordable and perfectly reasonable choice, then this may be for you. ",4,4,1,"",3
"High-Quality Headphones that Deliver Impressive Audio!","As a highly educated customer with a multimedia background, I know the importance of quality audio equipment. I recently purchased these headphones and must say that I am delighted with my choice.  The marketplace provided a smooth transaction, and my package arrived promptly. The sound quality exceeds my expectations; the bass is deep, and the trebles are crystal clear. Furthermore, the headphones' noise-cancellation feature is exemplary; it blocks out any outside noise distractions.  The headphones' design is sleek and comfortable, making them ideal for prolonged wear. The adjustable head strap and cushioned over-ear cups eradicate any discomfort that I have experienced with past models.  However, one aspect that disappointed me was the absence of a carrying pouch or carrying case. As a professional who is always on the go, it would have been an excellent bonus for ease of transportation.  .5 (rounded up to 5)","","","",1,4
"Title: Disappointing Purchase Experience of a Mobile Phone","The delivery of the mobile phone was reasonably quick and satisfactory, but that was the only positive aspect of the whole purchase. From the seller's communication to the marketplace's customer service, everything was quite vexing.  The seller was unhelpful and provided little assistance when contacted. The description of the phone online differed greatly from the actual product received. In addition, I had to deal with issues such as a missing accessory and scratches on the screen of the device, and when I brought those concerns to the seller's attention, they were dismissed without adequate clarification or compensation.  The marketplace itself lacked any meaningful customer support; their automated systems made it nearly impossible to communicate with a person when needed, and the response time was frustratingly slow.   As a highly-educated customer, with a good understanding of the importance of making satisfactory purchases online, I was looking forward to having a pleasant transaction, and so the experiences related to this purchase were a severe inconvenience.  To sum up, my expectations were not met despite my willingness to express any doubts, to communicate clearly, and being receptive to feedback thereafter.

Despite it not being something I bought in-store, I was impressed by the quality of the wallet itself. The leather was exactly as expected and it even smelt new! However, when it comes to delivery, it took longer than I was used to. So, if you're impatient like me, then you may find the wait a bit frustrating.  When it comes to the seller, my experience was buttery smooth. They gave me all the necessary information I needed from the start, and they even followed up on my purchase to ensure smooth transaction. When it comes to the marketplace -- and let's be honest, we all have slip-ups and need a good deal sometimes --- it was very much what I expected out of lesser-known online marketplace options with unclear directions, murky guidelines, and a semi-off payment system. Overall, I was very happy with my experience -- at least with the important parts.

"My New Headphones: A Cheeky Customer's Review","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and let's just say, it's been an interesting experience. The delivery wasn't exactly speedy but it was still bearable, even though I was a tad bit impatient with the wait. However, I must admit that I was quite pleased with the seller's service, they answered my messages in a timely manner and provided helpful information. As for the item itself, there were a few hiccups. Firstly, the headphones felt a bit flimsy in my hands and I wasn't fully sold on the design. Secondly, I was disappointed with the sound quality, as it could have been a lot better.  Despite all this, I must say I'm content with the headphones overall. They definitely do what they set out to do with playing my music and providing a sound canceling experience, that is when they aren't slipping off my head due to its less than sturdy fit. In the future, I may look to upgrade and further invest in headphones that tick all my boxes, but for now this pair will do.   ",2,3,4,2,3
"Disappointing Purchase: My Experience with a Mobile Phone","I recently purchased a mobile phone, and unfortunately, my experience fell short of my expectations. While I had no issues with the item's functionality, I must say that its appearance was rather disappointing. The images provided in the online listing certainly looked different from what I received, so that was a bit of a letdown.  The delivery experience was also marred with issues, which negatively impacted my overall experience. There were delays, and the seller wasn't very communicative, so I found myself having to constantly follow up and check-in with them.  Regarding the marketplace where I purchased the phone, I was less than impressed. I found the platform a bit difficult to navigate, and the options in terms of shipping and delivery were not as robust as I would have hoped. That being said, it was good to see reviews from other buyers, although I remain unsure if the phones being sold are reliable, as mine has given me some trouble already.

The style seemed to be exactly what I wanted, but upon receiving the dress, I was absolutely disappointed with the quality of the material. It felt flimsy and cheap.  Although the fit was a decent  and overall dress as depicted , the fabric made it impossible to feel comfortable in. Early on defect appeared at seams and stone work all fell off with small breeze outside(the day it came in the mail was particularly windy), leaving the dress looking shabby.

Unfortunately, my worst expectations came true. Let's start with the good: delivery was fairly quick, just a day later than indicated. That's where the positive things end.  The item itself was a disappointment. While the description stated it was new, it was clearly used, covered in scratches that could only have been caused by prolonged use. I'd give it maybe a 1.5 out of 5 stars for its condition.  The seller was not the most helpful one, trying to palm me off through appeals to the marketplace's terms and conditions instead of trying to engage with my complaints the way they should've. It did not sit well with me and I would rank them 2 out of 5.  Lastly, while the marketplace offered some advantages when it came to delivery speed and availability of products, it did not provide me with a satisfying experience. Finding out that there would be no way for me to submit a negative review as long as the seller had not accepted the damage as their responsibility was frustrating, to put it mildly.

As someone who spends a lot of time working in noisy environments, this feature is crucial for me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these headphones cancel out even the most obnoxious droning sounds.

"Review of Headphones Purchase: A Polite but Unhappy Customer","I was really excited to receive my new headphones, purchased online. However, I must say I am slightly disappointed with certain aspects.  Delivery took longer than anticipated and there was no tracking information provided. This resulted in some inconvenience for me, as I had to reschedule some important work appointments around the expected delivery time. However, the headphones were packaged well and arrived in good condition.  The seller was polite in responding to my queries but lacked detail in providing updates. There was little communication from their end regarding the status of my purchase or the delay in delivery. This prolonged the uncertainty and frustration I was already feeling.  On the positive side, I must commend the marketplace for resolving the issue quickly when I raised concerns. Their support team was prompt and helpful when contacted. However, it was quite upsetting that I had to contact them in the first place, in order to seek any resolution.  Overall, while the headphones themselves are of good quality and functioning as they should, I cannot give this purchase a higher rating due to the issues mentioned above.  .","",2,3,4,3
"""Stylish and Functional Wallet for Every Occasion""","I recently purchased this stunning leather wallet and I'm pleased with its overall design and functionality. It features enough compartments to organize my cards and cash while still fitting snugly in my pocket.

Other than that, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone in need of a stylish and functional wallet.  ","",3,"","",4
"A Mobile Phone Offering Cutting-Edge Features","As someone who's well-informed when it comes to top-of-the-line mobile devices, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. The phone boasts a sleek design, and combines form with function as it is packed with features that cater to both casual and power users.  While the phone may come at a slightly higher price point compared to others in its class, it's a worthwhile investment if you're looking for a device that not only takes care of your communication needs, but also offers some of the features you'd typically find on higher-end devices. The camera, for one, produces sharp and clear images, while the user interface is seamless and responsive.  Although the seller did a satisfactory job of delivering the product, I have to say that the marketplace needs improvement when it comes to addressing customer concerns or complaints. It took a tad longer than anticipated to respond and provide assistance, which can be rather cumbersome in case an issue arises.  All in all, I'm happy with my latest purchase, and look forward to several years of reliable use from this mobile device.  ",1,"",1,2,4
"Lovely Dress for Any Occasion","I recently purchased a dress that I absolutely adore! The dress is perfect for any formal occasion or just a night out. The material is high quality and comfortable to wear. The design is elegant, yet simple, which makes it very versatile.  One thing I noticed is the sizing is a little off, but thankfully I had read the reviews beforehand and ordered a size up. The length of the dress was just right for me, and it flowed beautifully when I moved. The color is vibrant, and the dress arrives wrinkle-free in the package.  The price of the dress is also very reasonable, especially given the quality of the product. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful dress.  ",5,"","","",4

While the seller was responsive and attempted to address my concerns, I can't say I was completely satisfied with their service.

"""Frustrated with my latest wallet purchase""","I recently bought a wallet online, and while the wallet itself was nice, the whole purchasing process left me feeling frustrated. It took far too long for the delivery to arrive, despite paying extra for express shipping, and this had nothing to do with the seller who seemed to be on time with their end of things. If it wasn't for that issue, based on the product alone, I'd rate my purchase very positively, but the experience was soured, to say the least.  Furthermore, I had difficulty navigating the vast marketplace in which I shop, and found myself getting lost often regardless of which filtering options I used. I would have loved being able to simply find what I wanted in a timely manner, instead of having to spend extra effort looking for what I specifically asked for from the search bar.  In short, if they could improve the logistics in some way, I would likely give the marketplace a higher rating than I have given it, but the hassle of the whole process took some of the pleasure away from my otherwise simple transaction.

"These Headphones were a Pleasant Surprise","I recently purchased new headphones and I must say that I was quite content with my decision. Initially, I was hesitant about the quality of the headphones as I have had trouble finding a pair that fit comfortably and didn't slip around while I was moving. However, these headphones are of great quality and stay in place. The sound quality is also great and they appear sturdy despite being completely wireless.  As far as delivery, I was disappointed with how long it took for them to arrive (arriving a whole week late), but the hassle didn't detract the satisfaction I felt with the item itself.   I have to say, the seller was great — they were accommodating and amiable when asked a highly specific question about the item. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the delivery timeline which almost convinced me they were lying time and again.

While the item itself is quite decent, it was not extraordinary, nor did it fully meet my expectations. I was unhappily delighted with the delivery process, which took much longer than I was initially informed, causing me some disappointment. The seller did not provide adequate customer service or follow-up, which greatly impacted my purchasing experience. The marketplace itself assisted me some, although I didn't find it too intuitive, reliable, or fairly competitive amidst competitors. What irked me, in particular, was the rather limited product offer and lack of transparency from everyone involved.

I was a bit skeptical about buying it online, but I have to say that my experience was quite positive overall.  Let's start with the delivery. It was not the fastest I have experienced, but it was not bad either. I received the package in decent time and in good condition. However, there was not enough protective packaging, so the phone box was slightly damaged.  The seller was okay. They responded to my questions in a timely manner, and they seemed customer-oriented. However, I did not receive the USB cable originally provided with the phone.  Now, let's talk about the phone itself. I am very happy to say that my overall satisfaction with it is quite high. The touch responsiveness is just perfect for me, and the screen size is ideal for watching online videos.  However, I have noticed that the phone temperature gets warm pretty quickly when it's being used, especially when I'm browsing the internet - definitely not something you want during the hot summer months.  All in all, my purchase through the marketplace was a good experience. The phone itself has some minor issues, but it is absolutely worth considering if you're looking for a new mobile device.

Firstly, the item took almost twice as long to arrive as the estimated delivery date. There were no timely updates on delivery either, which was frustrating. Secondly, the dress turned out to be of terrible quality. It was nothing like the image shown on the webpage, with crooked seams, loose threads, and stains that were too prominent to be ignored. The size was also slightly off, although that was not as much of an issue.  When I reached out to the seller, I did not receive any resolution or even a sincere apology, which added insult to injury.

I would've given it a full five stars if not for the somewhat stiff leather.  Alas, my gripe is not with the item or the delivery but the marketplace. My shopping experience would have been flawless apart from the problem I faced using this platform. I've always found better customer service with other online shops.

"Title: Comfortable headphones with decent sound, but disappointing seller experience","I recently purchased these headphones and have mixed feelings about the whole buying experience. While the headphones themselves are comfortable to wear for extended periods and the sound quality is decent, my experience with the seller left something to be desired.  Firstly, the delivery took longer than I anticipated, and the tracking information provided was not very informative. Additionally, the packaging was damaged upon arrival, which could have been due to shipping, but it's hard to tell. Customer service was slow to respond to any inquiries I had, which was also quite frustrating.  Despite the seller experience, the headphones themselves are quite good. They're lightweight and don't put too much pressure on my ears or head, and the sound is balanced with adequate bass and treble.

While the delivery was timely, there were many other aspects of my purchase that left much to be desired.  Firstly, the quality of the fabric used in the dress was not up to par. The stitching was sloppy in certain areas, and many of the seams looked cheaply made. Additionally, the sizing was off, as the dress was not fitted in the way that I had expected it to be.

The delivery was nearly on time and in great condition. However, throughout the process of purchase and delivery, I found the seller support to be lacking.

"""An Average Mobile Purchase: My Experience""","I recently purchased a new mobile phone and overall, the experience was okay. Delivery was prompt, and the seller was responsive to my questions, which I appreciated. However, I did have a few issues during my purchase process.  To start, the item itself did not meet my expectations. While it has the basic functions I need, it feels cheaply made and the camera quality is not as good as I was hoping for. On top of this, I had trouble with a few software glitches that took awhile to fix.  As for the marketplace, it was just average. The prices were good, but the selection of phones wasn't the best. Furthermore, the overall experience wasn't as smooth as I've experienced on other marketplaces.  Despite these negative aspects, I'm not completely dissatisfied with my purchase. While it certainly isn't my favorite mobile device I've owned, it will suffice for my basic needs. That being said, I'd give my experience a final rating of 3 out of 5.  ",1,4,4,3,3

Firstly, I was extremely disappointed with the delivery process. It took weeks longer than expected for my package to arrive, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Secondly, the seller itself didn't provide clear communication throughout the purchase, so I was left wondering the status of my delivery.  Furthermore, the marketplace that I used to purchase the headphones did not live up to my expectations. Despite being a highly-recommended platform, I was left dissatisfied with the level of customer service provided by the company to rectify the delivery issues.   On the bright side, the item itself met my expectations in terms of functionality and quality. Despite all the negative aspects of the purchase, I am glad that the headphones are up to par.

When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the material and the excellent craftsmanship. This wallet is great for someone who doesn't want to break the bank for a stylish and practical option.  While delivery took a little longer than expected, I was overall satisfied with the seller. They provided clear communication throughout the process, and the item arrived in good condition.  Although I couldn't find much information on the marketplace about the seller or the product, I took my chances and was content with the purchase.

"""The Perfect Mobile Phone for a Rustic User""","I recently purchased a new mobile phone that met all my needs as a rustic user. The phone seamlessly integrated with my country lifestyle, allowing me to capture great pictures of my farm and send messages to my family living in different parts of the country.  While the marketplace that I purchased this phone on did not quite meet my expectations, the phone itself is great value for the price. Its long battery life means I can use it for hours at a time without worrying about charging it. Additionally, the phone's sound quality is impressive, which I found helpful especially in loud country environments.  One of the highlights of this phone is its large and responsive screen. As someone who works outdoors most of the day, I find the sizable screen makes it easy to read texts and emails, and helps with navigating websites on a much better view.  However, I do think there were some areas where the phone could have been improved. Its connectivity with certain wifi networks has been inconsistent on a few occasions, but given my lifestyle this hasn't been something which caused major distress.  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. The phone has stayed true to mobile phone's key features i.e. calling, messaging and browsing that I needed it for. As a rustic customer, I would definitely recommend it to someone seeking an easy-to-use, budget-friendly mobile phone.   ","","","",3,4
"""Charming Wallet with Disappointing Delivery""","I recently purchased a lovely wallet, and although I'm only moderately satisfied with the item itself, I'm very pleased with the seller. The wallet is crafted with a charming rustic feel fitting my style, but its overall durability could be stronger. Unfortunately, the delivery left me feeling annoyed as it took longer than usual for it to arrive, and I'm not happy with the marketplace either. However, the seller was excellent in terms of both communication and packaging.  This wallet would indeed suit those who are looking for a temporary and stylish, more trendy option rather than the long-lasting or sturdy variety. Even so, a great item becomes insignificant when it arrives week(s) later than promised. As for the seller though, there were no issues whatsoever. The seller responded to my messages promptly, packaged the item with care and attention, and fully filled all their obligation in resolving issues - if there are any.

"DO NOT BUY: Unhappy with Mobile Phone Purchase","I am extremely dissatisfied with the mobile phone that I recently purchased. First off, the delivery took too long, which was frustrating. However, the real issue lies with the phone itself. The battery life, which is supposed to last all day, doesn't even last half a day. The camera quality is worse than my previous phone, which is quite disappointing since I used to take so many pictures. Moreover, the user interface was not easy to navigate, and I had to keep searching for things that should have been easier to find. The phone heats up very quickly, and the entire screen turns black. The only way to turn it back on is to press the power and volume down button simultaneously. This has happened several times, causing me to lose work that I had not saved. I must admit that I expected much more than this from such a well-known brand. Overall, I do not recommend buying this mobile phone.  ","",2,"","",1

After purchasing a new mobile phone, I am still unsure about my overall satisfaction. One aspect of my buying journey that was challenging was the marketplace. The process of finding reliable information was daunting, and I had to sift through many options. The phone itself has impressive features and can complete various tasks with ease. Its battery charge, however, doesn't seem to last as long as my previous model, which is disappointing. An enjoyable feature is the security measures that are installed to protect my information. The camera captures high-quality photos, but the colors seem a bit extreme and unnatural compared to other photos.

The headphones itself were satisfying with their comfortable plush design that helped me keep them on for long hours. The red hue adds a decent style to them without being too flashy. The sound quality was rich and clear with a commendable bass line that offered energy to my playlist. However, I had to tinker with the settings to balance out the sound as I felt the treble was a tad bit high.   When it came to the seller, their customer service was polite but they were unable to provide me specifics or tips about the controls, which was bummer.

"Disappointed in the Quality and Delivery Time of Headphones","I recently purchased a pair of headphones, and I must say I am quite disappointed with my overall experience. The item in question seemed fine at first glance but upon further inspection, I discovered that the sound quality was horrendous. The vocals were almost inaudible, and the bass drowned everything else out. It's certainly not the experience I was hoping for.  Delivery time was also a nightmare. It took an unacceptable amount of time for the order to arrive, and while I recognize that shipping delays can happen for a variety of reasons, the lack of communication regarding the delay was very frustrating.  While I understand that sometimes things don't go according to plan, I was particularly let down by the seller's lack of concern for my problem. When I reached out to them, they were unhelpful and offered little to no assistance.  Finally, I must say I don't recommend this marketplace being my first and only experience of that website to anyone.

"""Disappointing Phone Purchase""","I recently bought a new mobile phone and to be honest, I wish I hadn't. The seller I purchased it from had the communication skills of a turtle - meaning very little information was given to me during the whole process. Not only that, but the shipping was slower than advertised, making me wonder if there was any real urgency put into the sale at all.   When the phone finally arrived, it was missing a couple of key accessories that were advertised as included. It may not seem like a big deal, but those accessories actually had a big impact on my decision to buy this particular phone.   Another let down was the condition of the phone. I understand resale or pre-owned items aren't going to be pristine, but there were noticeable marks all over the backside that the seller never mentioned in their product description or photos.   One positive aspect I will note is that the phone is technically functioning, but to be honest, the experience of buying this phone and realizing everything wrong with it overshadowed any excitement I had for the gadget.   Overall, I would not recommend purchasing from this particular seller or even consider buying another phone via online marketplace in general. The disappointment and hassle just isn't worth it.

"Unimpressed with These Headphones","I recently purchased these headphones and I must say, I am not impressed. First and foremost, the delivery time was absolutely ridiculous. It took almost two weeks for them to arrive, which was an inconvenience as I had been looking forward to having a new pair of headphones for my upcoming trip. Secondly, the seller was not very helpful when I reached out to them for an update on the delivery status. They seemed unbothered and indifferent to my concerns.  Now, onto the actual headphones themselves. While they do produce crisp and clear sound quality, they are quite uncomfortable to wear for prolonged periods of time. The design looks sleek but offers minimal cushioning and the plastic material feels somewhat cheap. I also found that the headphones do not block out as much outside noise as advertised, which can be quite frustrating in noisy environments.  All in all, I regret purchasing these headphones and would not recommend them to others. The delivery time and customer service aspect were significant letdowns and the actual product did not live up to my expectations. .",5,2,2,5,2

Let's begin with the positive. The seller I interacted with was prompt in responding to my queries and provided helpful information about the product's features. In addition, the wallet itself is made of high-quality materials and looks gorgeous, with a sleek design that caught my eye.   However, while the wallet's appearance is wonderful, I wish I spent more time researching its capacity beforehand. Sadly, the wallet may appear stylish but not efficiently designed. There are fewer card guards than there are slots for credit cards, and although I can still barely squeeze them in, the management is not sufficient. Also, stitching quality disappoints me a bit, which means not durable to my two months of usage.  That being said, these missteps were made unknowing beforehand.

Even though I was eventually able to find the dress I wanted, it certainly wasn't an easy experience!  Eventually though, I connected with a seller who was selling the dress I wanted. They were helpful and polite throughout the buying process, and even though there were some small setbacks (like having to wait a little while after I paid before shipping began), overall things went well with them.

However, the battery life is quite short and often requires multiple charges throughout the day.  As for delivery, it was less than satisfactory. The package arrived a week later than expected, and the delivery service did not seem respectful towards the contents.  The marketplace platform, on the other hand, was much more impressive. The site was easy to navigate and had a plethora of choices. The only drawback was the cost as some comparable options had much lower prices elsewhere.

"""Not Up to Expectations"": A Review of my Recent Dress Purchase","I recently purchased a dress, and unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. While the delivery and the seller both scored high marks, I was disappointed with the overall quality of the dress.  Upon arrival, the dress appeared to be a different color than what I had expected. While this is a small detail, it added to the overall dissatisfaction. Additionally, the material felt thin and cheap. In essence, it seemed as though my money was not well-spent.  While I do not doubt the seller's integrity or commitment to consumer satisfaction, I do question the marketplace that I used to make this purchase. It appears that their vetting process for suppliers and products is deficient and not conducive to a high level of customer satisfaction.  In conclusion, I would not recommend purchasing dresses from this particular marketplace if quality is a major concern. While my experience with the seller was positive, the overall transaction left me disappointed. Hopefully, my feedback may help others when making their own purchasing decisions.  ",2,4,5,1,2
"""Exceptional sound quality and comfort with my new headphones!""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with my experience. The quality of the sound is exceptional - it really immerses me into whatever music or media I happen to be consuming at the time. The crispness and clarity of the sound is truly top-notch. Moreover, the comfort level of these headphones is extraordinary. I often wear them for hours at a time and I never experience any discomfort or pain.  The construction of the headphones themselves is quite remarkable as well. They feel very sturdy and high-quality, which is always reassuring when investing in a new piece of technology. Additionally, the headphones are very portable - they easily fold up and can be taken on the go.  One minor drawback is that the headphones are not completely noise-cancelling, so outside sounds can still be heard. However, this is a small issue that doesn't take away from the exceptional overall performance of the headphones.

The headphones arrived without an issue in a timely manner, and the packaging was adequate to protect from damage.  As soon as I put on the headphones, I noticed the quality of the sound was decent, but nothing spectacular. They're lightweight and fit comfortably even for extended wear, which is a plus. However, the headphones lack any noise-cancelling technology, which means that background noises can interfere with my listening experience.  Unfortunately, my satisfaction with the seller was quite low. They didn't respond immediately to my inquiries about the product, and it took a bit longer than expected to receive the actual product. As for the marketplace itself, everything went smoothly, and I'd 100% purchase something from that site again.

The sound is clear, and the headphones look stylish enough, but I find that they have a tendency to fall out of my ear sporadically. Additionally, one of the earbuds was slightly misshapen upon arrival, but it doesn't appear to greatly affect the audio quality.  Ultimately, while I am grateful to have headphones to use, I do wish that I hadn't been so quick to buy these specific ones. They aren't the best I've tried but they're not the worst either.

The delivery was quick, and I was really happy with that. Of course, who doesn't like fast delivery?   The seller was friendly and answered my questions, but there was one little thing that caught my attention. The price was a bit higher than I would have expected if I were to buy it directly at the store. But then again, buying on marketplaces accounts for differences like this.

"Good Sound Quality, Inconsistent Delivery, Disappointing Marketplace ","I recently made a purchase of a set of headphones and although I obtained my desired item I was disappointed with the delivery process and the marketplace’s customer support.   The sound quality of the headphones themselves is decent, both the low and high notes are well balanced, there is no observable divergence from the stated specifications. Despite the fact that some faults were seen during unboxing of the headphones, they still function cosmically.   On the negative side, let me describe my inconsistent delivery experience. The shipment was very enticing considering the website stated a clear delivery schedule, however, I received my shipment much later than I anticipated. To demonstrate my confusion, I tracked my package every single day and constantly debated filing a lost package inquiry, only for the package to gracefully arrive four days later.  Lastly, the marketplace itself was by far the most disappointing component of the whole procurement process. Their location is too remote from most major delivery companies, leading to difficult deliveries and costly shipping charges. Customer service assistance was shockingly inactive towards remedying my predicament, leaving me very disappointed with their means of resolving conflict.   ",4,3,"",1,2

"""Delicate yet Satisfactory Dress""","I recently purchased a dress online and was initially delighted to receive it. The item itself was what I was looking for, though it lacked the quality that I was hoping for. On the bright side, the material was light and breathable, making it suitable for a summer evening out.  Unfortunately, the delivery was quite a disappointment. It arrived later than expected and did not come with the tracking information that I had expected. This resulted in some unexpected surprises with the arrival date, but thankfully it did eventually come.  Luckily, I found the overall marketplace to be adequate. The customer service was prompt and professional, although I wished that they could have done more with regards to the delivery date.  Despite the disappointing delivery experience, I am still happy with my purchase. The dress itself met most of my expectations, and I loved the lightweight material. ",4,2,"",4,3
"Title: OK headphones but mediocre experience","I recently got myself a new pair of headphones and I must say, they are alright. The sound quality is decent enough, but it certainly falls short of my expectations considering how much I shelled out for them. They look pretty cool though, and they don't hurt my ears so that's a plus.   Unfortunately, I can't say that I had a great experience with the delivery. The package arrived way later than promised and was in pretty bad shape. The headphones were alright though, thankfully there was no damage despite the battered condition of the outer box.   The seller though, they were pretty good; always updated me with the shipment status and responded to my queries within a reasonable time frame.   As for the marketplace, it leaves a lot to be desired. I was hoping for a smoother purchase experience, but it wasn't as seamless as I would have liked. I won't explain why but I certainly noticed quite a few issues.   Overall, the headphones are satisfactory, but the delivery and overall marketplace left a lot to be desired.   ",3,2,4,2,3
"""Perfect Dress for Any Occasion""","I recently purchased a stunning dress from an online store and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with it! The fit is perfect and the quality of the fabric is exceptional. Not only is the dress versatile and can be worn for multiple occasions, but the intricate design is truly impressive.  The color of the dress is perfect for any skin tone and compliments my figure beautifully. The dress arrived in a timely manner which was a bonus! The price was reasonable for such a high-quality dress.  One minor downside is that the dress could have been packaged a bit better, as it arrived a bit wrinkled, but that's only a minor detail.

"Great Sound with Great Comfort","I recently found a new way to unwind and relax myself, which involves some great music and these fantastic headphones that I came across. I was happier to see that the delivery was prompt and arrived within a reasonably short time. I appreciate the good work put in by the company in ensuring that the packaging was perfect, a box inside a bigger box shielded to perfection.  The headphones were protected and pristine on arrival, just what anyone would want to see. The instruction manual included was straightforward for anyone. The device pairs quite easily with any smartphone with great ease. The worst part is having to keep recharging the device after every so often.   I can marinate myself within music, experiencing clear sound and noise isolation that helps me focus. There is the decent alignment of higher, mid-range and baseline frequencies and leaves me with minimal noise that can occasionally seep through when a song has a poorly executed grade.  Injuries often mean a limitation on neck movements in this case, opting for wireless headphones became my go-to solution. A great acquisition as the ear cups surround comfortably, being overly cozy amplifying any interesting read with clarity of mind.  I would highly recommend these wrinkle remedies tryout to great wireless headphones, albeit charging may become a lousy habit. Nonetheless, the sound capability, aesthetics, and capacity to block external turmoil exceeds expectations.  ","",3,"","",4
"I found the perfect wallet for a rustic adventure ","I recently received my new wallet and I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by its unique wilderness texture. It definitely adds flavor to my outings in the woods. The item's sizes are perfect, perfectly suited to accommodate all of the boat and hunting permits I use daily on my excursions, as well as money-cards, and which feel secure and well-protected inside. However, I must admit that the shipping was quite slow and approximately a couple more days passed than the usual waiting time of nearing ten days; sometimes precision is key in making an impression in today's business.   The overall shopping experience could be considered average. Sure, the prices could be more affordable for me, as a regular customer that hunts on a strict budget, trying to juggle too many expenses, moreover, advertisements during engagement could become quite annoying at specific moments; nevertheless not everyone should be happy in the same manner for everything.   Plus, I should not forget to specify that this wallet seems really sturdy, even with strong winds or complex climatic changes that can either compromise material quality or functionality; so you may consider using it even when you expect dramatic weather phenomena.

I was pleased with the materials used to make the dress which were of high quality and very comfortable to wear.   The only downside, however, was the sizing. I had to choose a smaller size than my usual, which luckily turned out to be a perfect fit. However, I think that some customers may need to order up a size or two than they normally wear to ensure that they get the perfect fit. Additionally, when I wore the dress for the first time, I noticed a small seam that started to unravel.

Moreover, the wallet's stunning black leather design is sleek and affordable.

On the positive side, the headphones themselves seem to be of decent quality. They fit well and the sound quality is better than I expected for the price I paid. I do find myself having to adjust them frequently while wearing them to get the best sound, but it's not a huge inconvenience.  One negative aspect of the purchase is that the cord is shorter than I would have liked. This can be inconvenient for certain activities where I want to move around too freely. Additionally, I found that during longer listening sessions the ear cups can be a bit uncomfortable as the material seems to cause skin irritation.  Overall, it's hard for me to give a strong rating.

The camera captures excellent quality pictures and videos, the display is crystal clear, the sound quality is exceptional and it has a decent battery life.   However, one downside I noticed is that it heats up quickly while playing games or using multiple apps simultaneously. Also, the storage space could be better with more internal memory but the expandable storage option compensates for this.   The user interface is easy to navigate and the setup was hassle-free. The design is sleek and stylish with a sturdy built that gives the phone an extra edge against accidental drops.   The customer service experience was excellent. The support team was courteous and efficient in addressing my concerns.   In terms of pricing, it's not the cheapest on the market but it's definitely reasonably priced for the value it offers.

I can go for days without having to charge them, leaving me more time to enjoy my favorite tunes without the hassle of changing batteries or having to plug in my headphones.  While the price range is slightly higher than some other headphones on the market, the quality and enhancing extras are worth every penny! One of the best parts of this product is the cord that connects both headphones. It’s short enough for me to not get caught up in any gears or branches, but long enough for me to be able to move freely.  Overall, these headphones are truly exquisite! While I had a couple of difficulties finding them through a qualified marketplace, the experience has been exceptional since then. I'd definitely recommend them to all people!   .","","","",1,5

The battery life of these headphones is better than the majority available on the electronics market, but quite frankly, I never position myself to grind out eight hours of continuous listening.

The materials used are so cheap that it looks like it will fall apart any minute, despite having only used it for a week.  What made things worse was the seller's dreadful behavior. As a rustic customer, genuine customer service is something that I value, and the seller clearly did not have this trait. I tried to contact them for clarification about the return policy, and their response was so unpleasant that I wasn't sure if the discomfort was solely due to their message or the wallet.  Moreover, the marketplace they used is nothing to be proud of. They should be more concerned with the offerings of its merchants than the endorsement of celebrity spokespersons. The wallet I received is a perfect exemplification of what a lousy quality product they allow to bother innocent customers.  Overall, it has been such a frustrating experience.

Communication was a bit slow, and I had a hard time getting specific answers to my questions. It was a bit frustrating, but I guess that's the nature of online shopping sometimes.   All in all, I would give this dress a solid rating. There are a few drawbacks, but for the most part, it's a good addition to my wardrobe.   ","","",4,"",3
"Disappointing Purchase Experience for Headphones","I recently purchased a pair of headphones for my home-workout routine. At first, I was excited about the prospect of having an excellent audio experience during my exercise routine. However, it turned out to be a complete disappointment.  The first difficulty I found was with the package delivery. Despite its advertised delivery, which seemed too good to be true, it took a lot of time than expected. It was a bad start to my experience since I was eagerly waiting to use my new headphones.  When I finally received my headset, I found that the sound quality was nowhere near appealing. The headphone promised the best auditory experience, but in reality it was average at best. It did not meet my standards or expectations.  Moreover, the headphones have frail wires that are prone to deterioration even with a slight jolt. Every movement would grind against the cords, and they started to behave erratically before quickly dying down. This significantly reduced my motivations to use the headphones.  The only positive about these headphones is their comfortable ear-sleeves that came along with the package, providing efficient off-site voice cancellation, keeping noise out even in a buzzy atmosphere.  In conclusion, I was extremely disappointed overall with my purchase. The delivery took too long, and the sound quality and precarious wires indicate poor workmanship. The few positive notes aside, I truly regret using these headphones, and It wasn't worth the shot.   . For me, inadequate work","",1,"","",2
"A reliable mobile phone for everyday use","I recently purchased a mobile phone from an online store and I've been quite satisfied with it. The delivery process was prompt and efficient, so I received the phone soon after placing the order. Overall, the smartphone seems to be in good condition and functioning well.  I particularly appreciated the seller's timely responses and smooth communication, which made my purchasing experience much easier. Any questions I had were promptly addressed which left me feeling more comfortable with the buying decision. A definite highlight of the experience .  However, I was not particularly satisfied with the online marketplace where I purchased the phone. The search function needed more refinement, and it took a while to get to the product details. On top of that, the whole buying process was a little complicated, taking from me more time for each step. While I managed to get the product eventually, I would have preferred a simpler user experience.  Overall, I'm pleased with my phone purchase, and it has turned out to be excellent value for money. It does everything that I expected it to do, including good camera and long-lasting battery. The features are easy to access, and the phone operates smoothly which means that I'm happy with the phone in end.  ","",1,5,3,4
"""Cozy and Casual: My Experience with the Rustic Dress""","This dress was just what I was looking for - something that would be cute for a weekend day out and about, but still comfy enough that I wouldn't feel too dressed up. The material is soft and seems pretty breathable, which is always my top priority when wearing dresses on a warmer day.  The delivery of this dress was a bit longer than I had hoped for, but overall it arrived in good condition and with the expected handling time. However, it did not arrive in the original packaging that other similar items have, which was a bit of a bummer since I was hoping to preserve the life of this piece for as long as possible.  As for the fit and style of this dress, I'm pretty pleased! It's a great length, not too short or too long, and can be styled in a variety of ways - on its own with sandals, with a denim jacket and boots, or even layered over leggings and worn with sneaks.  Overall, I'd say that this was a good buy for the price point - although the delivery was a bit underwhelming, the dress itself is a definite keeper in my closet.  ","",2,"","",4
"Disappointed with my Recent Wallet Purchase","I recently purchased a new wallet, which I was very excited about as I needed a replacement for my old tattered one. The delivery time was acceptable, but unfortunately, the overall quality and durability of the wallet left a lot to be desired.  One of the things that irks me the most is that the stitching around the edges of the wallet is not of good quality, causing the threads to come loose and the wallet to fall apart easily. Additionally, the material used to construct the wallet is not very sturdy, and I have to be very careful not to overload it with too many cards and coins, or again risk tearing.  In terms of the design, the wallet is not very modern and lacks features like a separate coin pocket that many of the newer ones have, but I was okay with that when I purchased it. However, given the other challenges I've experienced while using it, I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake.  Overall, I'm quite frustrated with my purchase and don't think it will last me as long as my previous wallet which served me 5 whole years. .","",3,"","",2
"My Experience with the New Mobile Phone","I recently bought a new mobile phone and have mixed emotions about it. The phone has a sleek design and its functionality meets my desired requirements. However, I faced minor difficulties during the purchase process.  Firstly, the price of the mobile phone on the marketplace was high, but I purchased it nevertheless. The delivery time was also not satisfactory due to delays in shipping. On a positive note, the product was well-packed and reached me in good condition.  Regarding the phone itself, I am happy with the features it offers such as excellent picture quality, long battery life, and ample storage capacity. Though the phone is quite large, which makes it a bit difficult holding in one hand and carrying it in smaller pockets. Also, talking on speaker mode can be challenging.  In conclusion, I am pleased with the mobile phone purchase overall but the challenges in purchasing it have left me with a feeling of uncertainty for next time.  ","","","",2,3

"Mixed Feelings on the Sound Quality of These Headphones","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and have mixed feelings about them. While the headphones were delivered promptly, the sound quality has not lived up to my expectations. I have experienced crackling and inconsistent sound, much to my disappointment.  Additionally, the material of the headphones seems a little flimsy and not particularly durable. This has created some frustration as I have had to handle them with extreme care not to damage them.  On the positive side, I do appreciate that these headphones come with a built-in microphone, which is great for when I take calls. Also, the compact size of the headphones makes it easy to store them in my backpack when I am on the go.  Overall, while there are some notable pros, the sub-par sound quality and delicate material are significant drawbacks. .",2,"","","",2
"The Cheeky Customer's Review of a New Wallet","I love receiving packages, and when the sleek leather wallet arrived at my doorstep, all wrapped up and ready for me to use, I couldn't have been happier. However, after testing it out for a few days, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.  When it comes to the wallet's durability, it appears questionable. The stitching has already started to come apart at the seams, and I'm not exactly using it roughly either. On the plus side, I do appreciate the wallet's compact size and how easily it fits into my pockets. Despite that, the longevity of the product does concern me a bit.  As for the seller, they were rather unremarkable. Nothing stood out, but I didn't have any major complaints either. The transaction proceeded smoothly, and they were quick to confirm my purchase. I do wish that they had mentioned the product's expedited shipping cost, however; it would have been nice to go in with both eyes open.  Finally, when it comes to the marketplace I bought this wallet from, I must say that I was somewhat satisfied. They have a decent selection of products, and I do find it relatively easy to browse through. On the other hand, the checkout process isn't as intuitive as I'd prefer, leading me to almost forget to provide my address info for shipping.   .",2,"",2,3,3
"High-quality headphones for a reasonable price","I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I must say I am incredibly impressed with the quality of the sound. The overall design of the headphones is sleek and looks stylish, making them suitable for both professional use and personal use.  The ear cups fit perfectly and the padding is very comfortable, even during extended periods of use. Additionally, the headphones feel lightweight, which eliminates any weight-related discomfort. They come with an adjustable and sturdy headband which allows the wearer to adjust it to the size of their head.  Another aspect I appreciate about these headphones is the affordable price. Despite the reasonable price, the build quality is impressive and feels very durable. Moreover, it's great that the product comes with a warranty.  While I have not experienced any issues with this product thus far, one minor criticism I have is that the cord is not detachable which can be inconvenient if you want to replace it with another cord in the future. Another thing to consider is that they do not fully block out surrounding noise, which can be seen as a drawback.  Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with my purchase and confident that it’s a solid investment. I would recommend these headphones to anyone in the market for high-quality audio products.

"Great wallet, but lacks some functionality","I recently purchased a new wallet and I must say I am generally pleased with it. The material is of high quality and it feels like it will last a long time. The delivery was also prompt and without any issues. However, I did notice that the wallet lacked some functionality that I am used to, such as a coin pocket for loose change. I found this slightly inconvenient, but not a deal breaker. Overall, I would recommend this wallet to someone who doesn't mind compromising on certain features for durability and style.  ",4,5,"",4,4
"""Reliable headphones for a casual listener""","These headphones are exactly what I was looking for as someone who listens to music frequently, but not necessarily at a high quality. I was pleased with the timely delivery, but the seller could have been more communicative about the shipping updates. Despite some minor hiccups, the marketplace made the transaction fairly easy overall.  As for the headphones themselves, they are comfortable to wear and produce clear sound for their price point. The design is also simple and stylish. However, they might not deliver great bass for those who prioritize it in their audio experiences.  Overall, I recommend these headphones for someone who is a casual and not too demanding listener. .",5,4,3,3,4
"""Inferior Headphones Disappoint - Buyer Beware""","I recently purchased a pair of headphones from an online seller which shall remain nameless. Sadly, I was disappointed with the quality of this particular product. While I cannot outright rate the marketplace where I bought these headphones, let's just say that I won't be returning there for any future purchases.  The biggest issue I had with these headphones is the clarity, or lack thereof. The sound quality is borderline unbearable. Another flaw is the durability. I had only used these headphones for a few weeks and noticed general wear and tear from everyday use. In addition, the headphones did not sit comfortably atop my ear; causing significant discomfort after continuous use.  Despite some of the negative aspects of these headphones, I will say that they are stylish, and lightweight. The dimensions were just right for my head size. The jack input is resistant, wide and fast, which ensured a good connection from the device.  In sum: whilst these headphones may have decent external features, the poor sound quality and wear of the product reduce their value astronomically. Consider a better brand or model before overpaying for these cheap headphones masquerading as a premium product.   ","","","",2,2
"Title: Disappointing purchase","I had high hopes for these headphones, but unfortunately, they fell short of my expectations. While the delivery was prompt, the headphones themselves left much to be desired.  First of all, the sound quality was mediocre at best. I expected clearer and crisper sound considering the price tag. Additionally, the headphones were not comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The ear cups seemed to squeeze my ears and the headband was too tight.  Furthermore, the noise cancellation feature was not as effective as advertised. I could still hear outside noises even with the ANC turned on. This made listening to music or watching movies in noisy environments unbearable.  To add insult to the injury, the headphones broke easily after only a few months of use. The left ear cup became detached from the headband, rendering the headphones useless.  Overall, I would not recommend these headphones based on my experience. Despite the prompt delivery, the poor sound quality, discomfort, ineffective noise cancellation, and short lifespan make this purchase a regrettable one.  ","",3,"","",2
"A simple but stylish wallet - Total rating: 4","I recently purchased a new wallet and I have to say I am quite pleased with it. The wallet has a minimalist design which looks great and provides easy access to my cards and cash. The leather feels soft and durable, so I expect this wallet to last for a long time.  When it comes to delivery, my wallet arrived in just a few days which was faster than expected. However, there was no package box which made me slightly concerned about the welfare of the product during shipping.  As for the marketplace, I am glad that I made this purchase as I had a positive experience throughout. The customer service was responsive and helpful, and the payment process was easy and secure.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase, though there are a couple of things that could have been better.

The material is high-quality and feels great on the skin - not scratchy or rough like some cheaper fabrics.   I had a bit of a worry regarding the sizing at first, but was delighted to find that it fits me like a glove! What's more is that it arrived sooner than expected. The packaging was secure, and there was no damage to the item.   One small downside I would point out is that the colors are slightly more vibrant on the screen than in person, which caught me off guard.

"Disappointed with my recent purchase","I recently purchased a dress from a certain online store and unfortunately, I am not entirely satisfied with my purchase. The delivery of the dress was quite prompt, however, the overall quality of the dress was underwhelming. The sellers' communication skills and follow-up response can only be described as unsatisfactory.   Although the dress looked exactly like it did in the photos, the overall quality was less than ideal. The material seemed flimsy and prone to wrinkling, and I did not feel confident wearing it to the occasion I had initially purchased it for. Additionally, one of the seams was already starting to fray when I received it.   The seller was not helpful when addressing my concerns. They were less than pleasant to communicate with and provided minimal solutions to fix the issue. The seller's disregard for customer satisfaction was distressing.  All in all, the marketplace needs to ensure that their sellers are held accountable for the sold items. Despite the low price point, it is no excuse for the lack of quality and almost non-existent communication. I would not recommend purchasing from this particular seller again.   ","",2,1,1,2
"Lovely Dress but Poor Seller","I recently purchased a beautiful dress from a seller on an online platform. The dress itself was perfect and just as described. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the seller. The lack of communication left me feeling frustrated and anxious, as I had no idea what was going on with my order for several days.  Delivery was on time, but I was disappointed at the condition of the packaging. It seemed as though the seller had just stuffed the dress into a plastic bag which caused a few marks on the fabric. Thankfully, they weren't too noticeable.  Despite these negative aspects, I am overall pleased with my purchase thanks to the reliable marketplace where I bought it from. This website offered plenty of options which enabled me to make an informed decision on a dress, and a structured and site-wide transaction system brought me peace of mind.  ",3,3,1,4,3
"Terrible Delivery and Seller, Decent Headphones","I'm usually a fan of leaving positive feedback, but unfortunately, I can't muster up anything but disappointment for my recent headphone purchase. Let's start with the good: headphones themselves are pretty decent. They were a bit smaller than expected, but produced good sound quality. However, the downside is they're not enough for me to overlook the countless issues I had with this order.   For starters, the delivery was an absolute disaster. Contrary to what the estimated date showed, it took almost 2 weeks to arrive. And, to top it of, when it finally did come- the package looked like it had fallen off a 3rd story balcony. I was almost shocked that the headphones were somewhat intact. Considering how long I waited for them and the conditions they arrived in, you could figure my disappointment in the level of care from the seller packaging them.   Speaking of, the seller himself wasn't much better. When I tried contacting them to express my unhappiness about the shipping, I got the impression that the seller didn't frankly care- essentially a mute response to everything. A little bit more customer service would've went a long way with me.  To sum it up: if you could get these headphones with a speedy delivery from a seller that cares, I'd definitely recommend them. In my case, though, my own personal experiences and frustrations make it´s difficult for me.  ",4,1,2,5,2

I felt they could have been more helpful in addressing my concerns about the wallet.  In addition, I was not pleased with the overall marketplace experience.

First off, the dress had quite a long lead time due to shipping reasons. Second, the sizing is not quite the standard that I am used to when shopping for clothes.

In addition, the color of the wallet I received was not nearly as vibrant as advertised. It is in my opinion that the marketers oversold this product, which is a shame because many people have dedicated hard earned money to it.

It took a bit longer than I would've liked to receive my purchase, but I suppose that's the cost you pay for convenience of online shopping. And the seller, they were fine, no issues there. Your as-average-as-they-come online seller.  The marketplace selling the wallet fares about the same in my book. It was functional and I managed to find what I was looking for with relative ease, but nothing stood out. It served its purpose, but I don't see myself coming back to the marketplace any time soon.

Within just a few days of use, the seams began to fray and the pockets on the inside were already showing signs of wear and tear. As someone who relies heavily on their wallet for daily use, this is incredibly disappointing.

The seller was also quite commendable. They answering all of my queries that I had with kindness and a willingness to help me make choices. Delivery wasn't too prolonged, either. Additionally, I loved that the price was better than brick-and-mortar stores without diminishing the quality.  Unfortunately, some minor nuances were more obvious once wearing the dress. The sizing chart isn't as precise as I initially thought, but thankfully my alterations skills were good enough to make it work.

"Surprisingly high quality","I recently purchased a wallet from this seller and I can honestly say I am impressed by the quality of the product. The wallet itself is sturdy yet compact, perfect for slipping into a back pocket or small purse. The leather used is soft to the touch and has that perfect rustic vibe that I was searching for. The stitching on the outside appears strong and unlikely to unravel anytime soon.  Delivery was a bit disappointing, but I understand that some delays are simply out of the seller's control. Unfortunately, my wallet took longer to arrive than expected, which did dampen my initial excitement. However, the seller was communicative and quick to respond when I reached out to them.

However, I am disappointed in the delivery process, which took much longer than expected, lowering my satisfaction rating in that aspect. The seller, though, was impressively responsive and friendly in assisting my queries, which quickly made up for the delay in the delivery.   As for the marketplace I bought the dress on, I faced few issues during checkout, but not too many that it could've been cancelled altogether. Frankly, there's still much room for improvement.

"""Fun and functional wallet, but with a few flaws""","I recently purchased this wallet and overall, I am happy with my purchase. The wallet is made of a high-quality material and has fun pops of color that add a bit of personality to my day. However, there are a few flaws that I’ve noticed.  Firstly, the wallet is larger than I expected, making it a bit bulky to carry around in my small purse. Additionally, the second more secure zipper compartment does not fit cash (only small coins), which can be a bit inconvenient at times.  Despite these flaws, the seller was fantastic to work with and responded quickly to any questions I had. Overall, I appreciate the fun and functionality of this wallet, but a few design flaws prevent me from giving it a perfect rating.  ",3,3,4,"",4
"Disappointing Quality of the Wallet","I was really excited to receive my new wallet after searching for a long-lasting and stylish one. Unfortunately, upon arrival, I was greatly underwhelmed by the quality of the wallet. The stitching was already coming apart and the leather felt thin and flimsy.   Despite my dissatisfaction with the item itself, props to the seller for answering my inquiries in a timely manner and for their courtesy. However, I cannot help but feel let down by the lackluster durability of this wallet.

"Poor Sound Quality Yet Relatively Productive","Headphones have become an indispensable item for my survival. Among my every attempted choice to get a new pair of headphones, I picked this one. The delivery phase went smoothly, and I had no issues. It got delivered in the expected time frame for an item in which I didn't receive instant delivery.  Given what is purported to be extensive reviews about headphones online, I was expecting high-quality sound quality with this one, but all to no avail. The item's quality is suitable for the price range; it seems hard to suggest anyone buy these headphones as its sound output is uneven and fluctuating. For people who attach importance to ""tonal balance"" and ""detail,"" I cannot recommend this headset. If looking for something that sounds remotely neutral, then my recommendation changes.  When it comes to build quality, there potentially could be some issues with consistent use. In this particular case, I'll see how long they hold up. Despite the cons, the headphones being comfortable to pack is an advantage. Furthermore, their genuinely active noise cancellation feature meets one of the primary objectives of a portable headset.  The seller was competitively-priced and put up a nice product character on his storefront. I haven't made use of customer care myself, though if confronted with issues and managed to reach out to them, a sufficient way of representation was there lined up for easy accessibility.

The delivery of my headphones was slow and there were issues with the tracking, causing some frustration during the wait. The seller was responsive but lacked in communication when it came to shipping updates.  Unfortunately, the marketplace where I made the purchase failed to live up to my expectations.

"A Sassy Sundress for Comfortable Days","I recently got my hands on a sundress that caught my eye and I decided to add it to my collection of dresses. The delivery was quick and that was something I appreciated very much.  As I unpacked this cute little sundress, I was a tad bit disappointed when I saw it wasn't as vibrant and colorful as it looked in the pictures but it was still a decent shade of pink. It proved to be a comfortable pick for casual days and perfect for hot summer days. I loved the unique design and style of this dress, but the material seemed to be thinner than what I expected, and it creases quite a bit after wearing it for a day.  Despite its shortcomings, it’s classy yet playful, with colourful floral printed midi length skirt. Perhaps a better quality of viscous to justify its cost than standard polyester. The tailoring is good, and the small touches – like the fitted top and tied back – made it a winner.  All in all a comfortable and stylish option that can be worn practically anywhere. While not perfect, I do believe its a solid buy for the price.                            ",3,"","","",4

Firstly, the delivery was delayed, leaving me waiting for several days before it finally arrived. As I opened the package, I was initially impressed with the appearance of the wallet. It looked sleek and elegant, but upon closer inspection, I noticed a few areas where the stitching appeared loose and poorly finished.  When I put the wallet to use, it quickly became clear that there were other issues too. For one, the card slots were too tight, making it difficult to fit in everything I needed without risking damage to my cards. Additionally, the coin pocket seemed like it could have been designed differently to better accommodate coins. Whenever I would put in or take out some change, the zipper kept getting caught.  To be fair, the material did seem of good quality, and the size was just right but overall, my experience left something to be desired. All together, these smalls details added up to create a bigger irritation, Leading me to consider replacing it sooner rather than later.
