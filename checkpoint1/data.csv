I ended up turning off the circle apps, which kind of makes the case just a case... with a hole in it. Second, the wireless charging doesn't work. I have a Motorola 360 watch and a Qi charging pad. The watch charges fine but this case doesn't. But hey, it looks nice."
1,US,31-08-2015,50800750,R15V54KBMTQWAY,B00XK95RPQ,516894650,Selfie Stick Fiblastiq&trade; Extendable Wireless Bluetooth Selfie Stick with built-in Bluetooth Adjustable Phone Holder,Wireless,4,4,,,0,0,A fun little gadget,"I’m embarrassed to admit that until recently, I have had a very negative opinion about “selfie sticks” aka “monopods” aka “narcissticks.” But having reviewed a number of them recently, they’re growing on me. This one is pretty nice and simple to set up and with easy instructions illustrated on the back of the box (not sure why some reviewers have stated that there are no instructions when they are clearly printed on the box unless they received different packaging than I did). Once assembled, the pairing via bluetooth and use of the stick are easy and intuitive. Nothing to it. The stick comes with a USB charging cable but arrived with a charge so you can use it immediately, though it’s probably a good idea to charge it right away so that you have no interruption of use out of the box. Make sure the stick is switched to on (it will light up) and extend your stick to the length you desire up to about a yard’s length and snap away. The phone clamp held the phone sturdily so I wasn’t worried about it slipping out. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver. But that will happen with any stick and is not specific to this one in particular. Two things that could improve this: 1) add the option to clamp this in portrait orientation instead of having to try and hold the stick at the portrait angle, which makes it feel unstable; 2) add the opening for a tripod so that this can be used to sit upright on a table for skyping and facetime eliminating the need to hold the phone up with your hand, causing fatigue. But other than that, this is a nice quality monopod for a variety of picture taking opportunities. I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."

I LOVE these style of Bluetooth headsets. This one is slightly different from my very first pair I got over a year ago. They are the same shape but this one is not as finished as my current set. The sound quality is not as clear as my QCY set but is pretty good. It has a nice balance of sound and the bass is sufficient. The sound quality is not like those expensive Beats or bose headphones, but it’s good enough for the price point. These go in the ear so it does block sound out. It blocks noise out so well that when I’m using these in the office, I can get more work done because I don’t hear the chatter of people around me. These use your standard micro usb cables so there’s no fear if you lose the cable that this set comes with. It charges up full in about an hour from dead and right out of the box it charged up in about 30 minutes. The battery life lasts me about 3 work days before needing to be recharged and that includes using it while on the way home from work which is a one hour minimum drive to and from the office. When using this for phone calls, you must leave the left ear piece hanging down around your neck. The microphone is on that earpiece. If you leave it in your ear, the person on the other end will not hear you clearly because the mic will be by your ear. The one thing this set is missing is a clip so you can clip that ear piece onto your collar for phone calls. If you’re like me and always moving around, if the earpieces shuffles around, the person on the phone can hear all the movement. Also, the volume button. It is very temperamental. When I try to hit volume up, I barely touch it and it adjusts volume. When I press down on it adjust volume it has a slow reaction. It’s almost like it works like a touch screen. Holding down the volume up and down buttons while listening to music will skip forward and back on your song list. With very minimal buttons, this is a very easy headset to use. It comes with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are. It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you. I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review.s with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.

Dropped this on cement, Hard Tile floor, on the sidewalk, and a few Other non carpeted areas. I don't know if it's the construction itself that makes it strong or maybe that LG Of Korea purposely made this phone very strong since it's marketed to teens and younger folks, or maybe it's because every time you dropped the phone instead of it's falling all in one piece and absorbing all the Impact, the back comes off and the battery comes out oftentimes but when you put it back together it works fine. I even had a few front facing dropS so many times I thought oh my God this is it my phone is shattered but I was wrong I am so confident in this phone that I Could do a ear height drop test anytime anywhere and I'm 100 percent sure it won't break and I'm 5ft 10. I don't even have a case on it it's just the screen protector and that's it. Good Conversation starter (The Eyes) you have no idea how many conversations have started Because of this. Me: *Takes my phone out of my pocket to see notifications* Her:  Omg, does your phone have eyes? Thats sooo cute Me:yeah, it's a lil phone from Korea. The Lg aka. check it out it's eye's move too. It even blinks too Her: Thats so adorable, Im ******* by the way. Continue talking and i ended up getting so many kiks/phone number because of that but i digress. (It's Still Corvette over females doe) A great way to break the ice. Audio The Sounds sounds great coming through the speakers no cracking or nothing like that, it's not super loud but if you put it at full volume here and enjoy it even if you're a good distance away. earbuds, it works with every pair of earbuds I have very compatible. Crisp .plus with the LG software their version of the music app you have the option to increase t, the treble, all that. I love that features some songs just don't sound the same without all that bass.let's see what else can I say about the sound? the notifications can be nice and loud. And yeah if you're really into music this is a great phone. Design if you are coming from some other company and you're used to the buttons on the sideit'll take a little while but eventually you'll get used to the volume rockers and power button being on the back. and if you don't want to have to deal with that this phone has knock knock you tap on the screen twice to wake it up and then you can enter your password and all that instead of using the little button on the back. and most of the time you can use the littles options At top to adjust the volume but as I said before it's pretty easy To get used to. Plus the phone looks nice, its not ugly. Call quality The call quality is decent. I thought since this phone was from overseas the call Quality might be off but now it's on point. Texting works normally too . The speed if you are used to be mid-range phones, this is quite a little Speedy One. The Flex factor lots of people buy Phones As fashion statement, the question is if my put his galaxy/iPhone/Note/ on the table and you put yo phone next to theirs how would it stack up? I would give this phone a 7. Its pretty nice and if you keep it clean(its easy,every not and again wipe wit a lil rubbing alcohol) you can flex on anyone. Looks like one of them $700 Flagships. If yo guy friends see the eyes however they might clown ya. But that don't matter. The eyes are cool to me and that's all that matter. Security Lots of options to keep it safe. Bunch of lock options and it has lookout too.at least mine did you might have to install it. accessories If you like customization this phone comes with funny lil stickers to put on it. If you older you might not care but i found this cool. Weight Its not heavy. I likes this. OsThe operating system is Kitkat, I personally like KitKat. it gets the job done and it doesn't have too many features that I'll never use thatll just drain my battery. Memory 16 gigs of internal space . And thats good considering my other phone before this had 8 . Up to 32 gb with a memory card but I used a 64 gb chip and it's worked fine. Auto focus lazer Cool feature on the camera very useful. And it can shoot high resolution video Battery lasts a while. I can get 6 hours wifi on heavy use but if the brightness is at 100 you lose some up time. And if yiu get a replacement battery you can just switch it out bam. Cons Camera isn't highest quality. Kinda grainy. Not waterproof/Water resistant. Thats how my broke. Not broke but it's messed up pretty bad. Price. Depending on what color you get this can go up to be 300 dollars, them Amazon vendors tryna rip y'all off this a $200/$250 Phone don't be rash wait till the price go down. Front facing camera is not that great either but you can see so its not complete trash. Too much stuff. Too many apps pulling on the ram makes it studder occasionally. Not bad but you'll notice it. 5 inches. I came from 4.7 in, i though well .3 in isn't that big of a jump but I was wrong, sometimes I have difficulty reaching the top of the screen to pull down my notification thing. Not the phone fault my hands just wasn't for 5 in. Micro sim. I had a regular sim. But its alright T-Mobile switch it and gave me a new one free. I lied at the start. You should buy this if you think it's cool"

The problem now seems to be fixed. About the camera itself...it's a really good little camera, the picture is really clear and the colors are very natural. This camera rivals many more expensive models. Take a look at the YouTube videos, they speak for themselves. The only problem I have (with any of these cameras) is, the setting buttons are really small, for a man's hands that can be a problem, but other than that I really don't have any other complaints with this camera. It does what it was designed to do. The company is really nice to deal with if you do have a problem, like with any electronic device, things can and do go wrong sometimes, but this company responds quickly to rectify a problem which keeps their costumers happy. Over all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this very reasonably priced camera to any one looking to purchase a car camera. When an accident happens, and they do, it's nice to have a visual account to protect yourself. This is a very sensible purchase for anyone."

Pleasantly surprised.,"Works as described. I bought it to have earphones with some noise blocking capability for use on a tractor. I have ear-bud phones which block noise and these block better with better sound and no more gooey-squishy-sweat in my ear canals. I have paired it with 2 tablets (one android, one Windows) and my phone all easily. Good sound quality. Does not block enough outside sound to serve as hearing protection, nor would I expect it to, but it is close and works well for my needs in a tractor which isn't very loud. Pros: Good sound quality. Voice notifications lets you know on/off/pairing. Comfortable (fits fully over my ears). Range; I tried pairing to my phone when outside ready to hit the tractor and it wouldn't do it....came to realize it was still connected inside to my tablet which I had to go inside to disconnect. Nice compact case. Cons: At this price point I can't complain. The USB charger cable is unique and may be difficult to replace (USB to mic jack). They feel flimsy but then that means they are lightweight and comfortable for work-use or long games. Unknowns: I haven't run the battery dead yet to know run time; at least a few hours. Microphone; haven't tried it. Bottom line: when these wear out I will get another pair. I will probably buy two more for my kids for road trips as they have systematically destroyed the wire with each wired set that I have bought them."

The suction mount and positioning abilities are very high quality. I use a 5.5 inch screen phone and a thin, hard-shell case. The thin, metal plate fits easily between the back of my phone and its case, and it holds very firmly on the TechMatte's magnet. I don't need the gripper portion, although it is also very nice quality. And while it holds firmly, it also comes off when I want to grab my phone. What I like the most about this mount is the ability to quickly put the phone on, or take it off with one hand and no fumbling about. You can place the phone on it lengthwise, or straight up and down without difficulty. Once on, the phone doesn't move while I'm driving through any turns, stops, or bumps. It's just plain easy, reliable and functional. The mount's suction cup is the best I've ever used -- and I've used many over the years. It'll hold firm on any windshield, or on a dashboard horizontal pad. The angle adjustments are easy to use, also high quality, and they hold firmly once in place.

If they didn't cost so little (especially for wireless) I would rate lower but for $23 I got what I paid for. They'll replace my corded headset for doing physical work but only because I've had it with ripping corded phones out of my ears. They won't replace my corded phones while at the office though. The drivers lack bass and there's a slight tunnel effect to the audio. This is however my first Bluetooth headset so that may be typical. These are meant for wireless convenience and I'll give the sound quality a pass at this price point - they do what is necessary of them. All of the buttons besides the MFB are conveniently placed and easy to use, but the MFB button is located towards the inside of the earbud instead of the back so you have to almost pull the the earbud out to access it - especially with the rubber waterproofers installed. I can't attest yet to the battery life. If they last 5 hours at a time I'll be happy. The start/stop feature stops working occasionally and I have to unlock my phone before I can stop the music from the headset. This may be an issue with my phone though, a Moto G first-gen. And finally the rubber buds were all but useless. In the attached picture you'll see of the buds that came on the headphones (to the farthest right in the picture), one was larger (top) than the other (bottom). And then the other 2 sets were defective in that the rim that attaches to the stem of the headphones is at the front of the earbuds instead of the back. For instance if you look at the earbuds to the right of the picture (the ones that came on the headset) you'll notice (or not) the black rim is in the back. But the other 2 sets (left and center) you'll notice the front of the buds are dark - that is the rim which is supposed to be in the back.So these other 2 sets only attach if you put them on backwards, i.e. with the output hole onto the stem. I docked a star for this and thought about RMA'ing but because of shipping/handling charges and the fact that I have other rubber buds from other sets I've purchased in the past, I didn't bother. I was hoping for more but got about what I expected. My biggest disappointment was in the defective rubber buds."

Not so! In just two weeks of use, this thing has told me to leave the road twice, and taken me to a gas station that hasn't been a gas station in years. The first time I used it, I was in a familiar area, and if I hadn't known that the GPS was trying to take me down horse path (literally) I'd have been in trouble. I'm pretty disappointed at the accuracy, and the database is just 'so-so'. And, it took 14 hours to update the database from my USB on my computer, which I did right out of the box. May have been my PC (I don't think so), but that big of an update made me think it'd be accurate in terms of closed facilities and road accesses. It's not. The feature that I do like is having rest stops, truck stops and available bathroom stops at the touch of a button (even if they're not terribly accurate), so we're going to keep the thing, rather than return it. I now run both this mediocre thing AND my Google Maps navigation on the smartphone at the same time, 'cause I don't completely trust the Garmin, but Maps doesn't have the one-touch access for stopping points. Wish there was one unit that did everything we wanted... hard to believe in this age of technology that there isn't... :-("

My arms do not get tired from holding the apparatus for the short periods I feel comfortable using it.

Item arrived in a very timely manner. The actual materials of this 3 piece case appear to be very rugged. The only exception might be the belt clip (time will tell). However, once you put the silicone gel around the phone, then proceed to slide the phone into the middle bracing part, you have no way to avoid putting stress on the volume rocker and power buttons. You just have to work those buttons into the cutouts. If, like me, you choose to use the belt clip case, inserting and removing the phone can be a challenge. At first, I found myself accidentally taking screen shots because of the pressure being put on the power and volume rocker buttons while sliding the phone in and out of the belt clip case (very tight). Plus the gel covering tends to fold up when pulling phone out. The solution? Well, this is a flip screen phone, so I just put it into the belt clip case right side up even though I would rather put it in right side down (The reason: hand down at side to hand up at ear. Results when I pull the phone out, the phone goes from right side down in case to right side up at ear). Overall Pros: 1) Material used appear to be very durable. 2) Kickstand seems to work very well. Overall Cons: 1) Phone is tight in belt clip. 2) Silicone gel gets a lot of friction when putting in and pulling out of belt clip case. 3) Although silicone gel cover has some notches on the sides, feels a little slick. 4) Molded area for earphone plug isn't big enough for a complete flush connection. ... On a sidenote, I accidentally purchased the same two cases from two different sellers, thought I was ordering two DIFFERENT cases (my bad). Once again, not the worst case but could be better. Nothing against either seller, they were great!"

It was so useful and we are so glad we had it! Whenever our phone batteries got low, we plugged them into this power bank and they charged right up. The unit has a lot of power and is perfect for airplanes or day trips when you don't have constant access to a charger. We didn't have to conserve our phone batteries and were able to use our phones as we normally would, taking pictures, checking email, etc. It has a little pouch that it fits into which was convenient. It is kind of an awkward size and would be inconvenient to carry around if you don't have a bag or a purse, since you need to have charging cables as well. I always carry large purses, so this wasn't a problem for us. I like that this power bank has a power switch as well, and it tells you how much battery remains. It has a flashlight on it as well, which I don't think we really have used, but I guess it would be nice for trying to plug in your phone in the dark. We charged this power bank every night (by plugging it into the wall) and always had enough power for 2 smart phones throughout the day. So convenient that you can plug 2 devices in at once. If you can get this for a good price, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this portable battery charger to anyone who uses their phone constantly!"

The automatic autherntication does not work and the offline setup doesn't either.
 The super secret code it generates does nothing. You copy that to one window then type in the other super secret code that comes on the back of a book, hit authenticate or whatever and it terminates, saying you should make sure the unlock request is entered correctly. Well, yes you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You cannot play even offline and you have to start all over again. There is a securerom link to go to if you can't get it working. It doesn't work either.
 It's so secure you can't access it. I do have the xbox version so I can play it but I prefer PC gaming.
Maybe the steam version is the way to go. I haven't tried it and am not planning to buy the damn thing a third time but that might be the way to go instead of footling around with the disc version. I do not recommend wasting your time trying to get through Rockstar's DRM. Honestly you idiots, pirates will pirate. Regular users are the ones who get scred by DRM. When will you learn?"

This stand with switchable dual fans helps keep your PS4 at optimal performance temps. Plus it adds dual charging stations for controllers and adds two extra USB ports. While this item comes with no instructions on setup it's still very easy to connect. Just know that this stand doesn't &#34;Lock In&#34; your PS4 and while it firmly supports it vertically it will not prevent an accidental overturn if you do not have it on a firm shelf.<br /><br />The dual fans make some noise but not enough to distract you over background noises. As for the USB ports, you connect a USB lead from the stand to one of the open ports on your PS4, this gives you one open port on the PS4 and 3 USB ports on the stand itself. Also if you have the PS4 settings in Rest Mode it will automatically shut down the fans when it turns off power to the USB ports.

Some of the intensity of hockey is lost on TV, the relaxation of watching a baseball game on a nice day surpasses sitting in the living room. But sometimes the commentary adds a lot to the game. A bit of context, some history, something you wouldnâ€™t get being at the game itself.<br /><br /> Iâ€™ve played, and enjoyed, each of the Batman Arkham games that have come out. Arkham Knight is no different. It has an open world to explore, the same melee style combat and stealth action as previous games. There are a few additions to the game. A heavy dose of Batmobile, an overhaul of the game world into utter chaos, a new hierarchy of villains and a more involved cast of supporting characters. Itâ€™s the same style game revamped, and a little darker than previous installments.<br /><br /> The game picks up with the death of the Joker from Arkham Origins. Itâ€™s Halloween of the following year and after a threat to the city everyone but the police force evacuates as gangs and militia take over. The primary adversary through the game is the Arkham Knight, a militaristic, unknown villain who leads a mercenary army into Gotham under the direction of Scarecrow who is trying to release a massive dose of fear gas into the city.<br /><br /> There are two big additions to the game. The well-advertised, and a bit controversial Batmobile which can be switched between a high powered sports car and a tank. While the tank combat is enjoyable, though fairly easy since enemies telegraph their attacks, the heavy reliance on the Batmobile can become cumbersome. Flying from rooftop to rooftop is both enjoyable and quicker than driving through Gothamâ€™s winding streets most of the time, but there are numerous sections of the game where the Batmobile is shoe-horned into the gameplay. Open up an area, go back for the Batmobile to open up the next section, rinse and repeat. While the car adds some nice variety to the game it can act like an anchor, slowing down gameplay by making you use it. The other big addition to the game is the Joker as a supporting character. This, to me, is the more enjoyable of the additions though it doesnâ€™t really add anything to the gameplay. Through events in the game the Joker becomes part of Batmanâ€™s psyche, visible and audible to Batman, but no one else. He provides commentary on events and pokes at Batmanâ€™s actions. While the games are fun of their own right, the color commentary really adds something special to the game. It provides greater context of the events and humor in an otherwise serious game.<br /><br /> The world is very similar to the past two installments in the series, Arkham City and Arkham Origins, a sprawling cityscape of Gotham. The game takes place over the course of a single night so itâ€™s always dark and raining from beginning to end. The main difference in the world is that the city has erupted into utter chaos. In the previous games gangs roved the city, but Arkham Knight takes it to another level as a militarized force has moved into the city alongside the normal array of gangs filling the city streets and making it more likely to run into a fight going from point A to point B.<br /><br /> The normal array of hand to hand combat and stealth carries over from the previous games. You swing from rafter to rafter or crawl through ducts taking out enemies one by one silently until you burst out, or the more likely scenario for me is being seen, for hand to hand combat. The same array of gadgets are available to you as previous games in the series, the bat claw, the disruptor for turning off weapons, smoke pellets, you get the idea, with a few new additions like a voice modulator, which really just put up more walls to progression that you unlock through the story. There is a new fear take down mechanism that allows you to do multiple takedowns in a short period, along with a series of new automated enemies such as drones you can hack and automatic turrets you must avoid. As mentioned before the Batmobile is now playable and there is a good amount of tank combat which is nimble and enjoyable. You steer the Batmobile which is able to move in all directions quickly, while you combat automated tanks which telegraph their attacks with light beams that change color when they have a lock. It makes the combat a bit simplistic, but itâ€™s a nice change of pace from the normal melee combat you usually encounter in the games.<br /><br /> The graphics look great. The city is dark and ominous. The characters are well rendered and the voice acting is still superb. The main complaint I have with the presentation is there are times where Batmanâ€™s mouth doesnâ€™t move while speaking.<br /><br /> There is a ton of side content, but it can be a little annoying. While the content itself is well-done, it involves finding it. Sometimes radio banter will alert you to where the event is, but even with that it can be difficult to locate at times. It would be nice if once you get a clue as to where the content is it would mark it, but it doesnâ€™t. Sometimes I would hear some banter that would alert me. I would fly in the direction indicated but not see where the event was and there wouldnâ€™t be any more banter.<br /><br /> Arkham Knight is a great game in its own right. Itâ€™s another high-quality installment in a great series. But the addition of the Joker to provide commentary really puts things over the top. It may not actually add anything to the gameplay, but getting a glimpse at Batmanâ€™s thoughts and insecurities is a great added bonus to the game. The commentary may not be a focal point, it may not be something any focused on, but it really adds something to the game. It can help fill in the gaps, it can help bring things alive, it can help give a glimpse at something I wouldnâ€™t have been able to see otherwise. It also makes up for some of the short comings that have arisen with the new mechanics. The additional barriers to progression you have to unlock, having to hunt down side content or the sometimes overzealous use of the Batmobile."

With each release, Disney manages to stuff their game with so many things to do, and 3.0 takes this further with a mind-boggling amount of content to tackle. Long after many AAA hardcore games are completed, Disney Infinity will keep chugging along with something new to find. Having Star Wars to bring in their latest series was a no-brainer for Disney - and everyone predicted it would happen. I'm happy to say, Disney went into overdrive with this release as they have done the Star Wars license mighty justice. The gameplay is spot on this time with fun quests and tons of side missions. Unlike the previous Marvel Super Heroes, Star Wars's missions vary from ground to space, keeping the adventures fresh at all time. The combat is highly improved with spectacular moves that are more complex and satisfying. I mean, come on - lightsabers? That's all you need to know. Both Twilight of the Republic and Rise against the Empire are equally enjoyable, and even after completion, you'll be back to revisit and will find much more to do.<br /><br />Back on Earth, without even firing up one of the Star Wars Playsets, you'll find an overwhelming amount to explore, thanks to the Toy Hub (not to be confused with the Toy Box). The Hub is the center for everything. It's segmented like a pie, with one section for racing, another combat, platforming, etc.. Each section has an intro level and sub levels that you can play which introduce you to the game's mechanics. It's brilliantly put together. One particular area host a farming simulator for your sidekicks. Oh, sidekicks are mini-sized Disney characters that hang with you during your questing. They can be told to follow and fight along, or farm for vegetables and other surprises. As your crops grow, you can feed your sidekicks to increase their stats. Better stats equals more abilities like cooler weapons, and other interesting gear. It really adds an RPG feel to the infinity series, and those little folk are pretty kick butt in battle! When I first heard about farming being added to the series, I was scratching my head, but from what I heard, people are spending hours just in that section alone!<br /><br />The Disney Main Street area of the hub is a sight to behold, and it's here where you can stop at Flynn's Arcade (of Tron fame) to jump into some on-line multiplayer games, or hang out at the El Capitan theater and play community levels, or even watch videos based around the game. Trust me when I say, the Hub is going to keep you real busy. And finally, there's the Toybox, the heart of the Disney Infinity empire.This time around, the ToyBox has received a lot of new gadgets and scenery, so expect an abundance of community levels that utilize the new features.<br /><br />Besides the two Star Wars PlaySets, there is currently a third which is based on Pixar's awesome animated movie, Inside Out. This takes a different approach than the other sets, as it brings pure 2D/3D platforming bliss to the table, and dazzling it is! Then there are the two expansion games. Unlike the playsets, which come with characters and an adventure crystal, these expansions are just a special single disc. When dropped on the portal, they add an all new game to the already massive mix; currently, there are two: Toybox Takeover which is a dungeon crawler where any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars Character can quest , and the highly touted DI Speedway, which is a Mario Kart-like racing game. All these sets unlock even more toys to add to the already massive selection in the Toybox. Oh, and if that wasn't enough, there's more DI goodness coming down the pike later later this year, including a new playset based on the upcoming, highly anticipated movie in the Star Wars saga, The Force Awakens, and an all out brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.<br /><br />With all the excellence that is 3.0, there are a few things that I feel need attention:<br /><br />- Saving a game on the Disney Cloud using the PS4 is still super slow. I'm not sure how is is on other formats.<br />- Some of the tools in the Toybox I thought would have made the jump to light speed like the rest of the game, instead, they remain the same, like the yellow trigger cube which is cumbersome to resize.<br />- The Toybox still restricts certain actions to a certain type of toy. For example, if you want a particular object to be &#34;collectible&#34; in a quest, you can only use what the developers chose as a collectible item. At least there's a better selection than last year.<br />- This year's amazing new path creator is great for making objects follow an assigned path. It will surely take community games to a whole new level. The first thing that came to my mind when I read about the Path Tool's capabilities was ROLLERCOASTERS! Well, turns out - there's no coaster track, train track, or even a coaster car. There are coaster sounds effects, though? Odd, right?<br /><br />In closing, there are so many features with Disney Infinity 3,0, it would be painful to have to write a review and list them all. Whether you're 6 or 65, you're in for one of the big gaming treats of 2015.brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.

The LED lighting is nicely colored and visible, without being bright to the point of blinding at night. However, my favorite thing is how the mouse sits in my hand. On my Cooler Master Storm mouse, I have to have a bit of a claw grip for it to fit properly, but this sits great.<br /><br />As for the mouse pad, it's nice, but I don't really know what to look for in mouse pads. It sits well on my desk, it's decent sized, and doesn't slide around at all."

In terms of graphics they are decent, but even walking around causes the game to twitch and lag. Its a chore just to get from one side of a town to another. Then in battle sometimes the game doesn't load the enemy animations when you hit them at first so they just kind of stand around like they are not sure what's going on. If you can look past all of that you then have the constant fear that the game will crash, and you WILL not get through a play through without it crashing, you just have to hope you don't lose a character and have to start all over (that one happened to me... Thanks lionhead). For some positives the story is ok and the characters are engaging enough to hold your attention. But honestly with all the bugs and fear based anxiety its probably not worth anything more than a boredom induced rental."

I love that this can be plugged in anywhere using a USB adapter.<br /><br />The charging station seems to charge the controllers pretty quickly and puts on a near little LED light show while doing it.

Only problem I ever had so far is the EA servers being so slow to log onto.

When you exit out of the game, you can go right back in and pick up where you left off. Well if you turn off your Xbox and come back a day later, you will try to pick up where you left off and find that it just says loading and never logs into the EA servers. I found that I would have to start another game and eject the Madden disc and log out. Then put the Madden 16 disk in and let it load. It would load from the beginning and work right away and the kinect would log me back into my account. I only have to do this for Madden."

The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.

I want to clear something up that ive read in some comments on the boots. These boots are fairly thick leather and have a long break in period if they hurt your feet thats just how its going to be for a little while the only advice i have to offer people with that problem is bet better insoles and you can ride out the stiffness and then realize these are very well priced. Only complaint is the massive price increase for large sizes i wear a 14 US or aka the 13 UK and paid 150 were someone with like a 9 US paid 80 when I bought them a while back.

Assuming I would want a snug fit for water shoes I sized down to the 7s in these and they were very loose which would have caused a lot of drag and slipping walking on river beds and such. I received the 6 today and they feel like a perfect fit, snug enough that I am hopeful they'll maintain this comfort when wet. These are shown as women's sizes, but as I wear a 6 in men's athletic shoes, I'd suggest just buying whatever your men's equivalent size would be.

I usually wear a size 7.5 in nike athletic shoes, since sandals normally run a bit smaller than athletic shoes I ordered a size 7 in women's and they fit perfect. They are slightly wider than thong sandals but they were not too wide and I think the slightly bigger width adds to the comfort. I normally don't like slide sandals because they fall off my feet but these are made of a special rubber and they kind of stick to your foot so they don't fall off easily. The rubber sole on these feel like those anti fatigue kitchen mats, I think they are much more comfortable than the memory foam sandals nike makes. The only reason I rated these 4 instead of 5 stars was the price. I know the purple/pink color is hard to find but these shoes really shouldn't cost over $30 and the ones I bought were $56 so they were overpriced. You can get the black color for $30 at most stores, however I have only been able to find them in mens sizes. For reference I wear a size 7 in womens but when I ordered the black pair I wore a size 6 in mens (even though the chart said I should get a 5). Would I buy these again for $56, probably not, but I really wanted the purple/pink color and they were a splurge. I still love these shoes though and they are exceptionally comfortable, you won't be disapointed!"
