"Do not buy this wallet!","I ordered this wallet and it took forever to arrive. However, the seller was great and very responsive. But what's the point of being responsive when you have a poor-quality product? The wallet is flimsy and feels like it will fall apart any minute. It's not worth the price, even if the seller was great. I'm not too happy with the online marketplace where I did the purchase, the search filters were not clear and gave me too many irrelevant options. ","",5,5,4,2
